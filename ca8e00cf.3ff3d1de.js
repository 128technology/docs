Routers are grouped together as a pair of nodes, with each unit processing traffic and sharing the network load. Each router consists of two units acting as a stateful HA pair. Active/active clustering provides stateful failover in addition to load sharing. A fabric link between the routers is used to route traffic between them in case of failure.
