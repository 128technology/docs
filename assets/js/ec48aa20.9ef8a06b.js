Two changes were made to resolve this issue:\\n\\n1. A verification step was added to ensure successful DNS resolution before starting IPsec tunnel.\\n2. A watch dog service was added to monitor IPSec tunnel services and restart them every 30 seconds if not.\\n\\nDuring the initial boot process of a router with the IPSec plugin enabled, the WAN interfaces can take some time to fully come up, creating two interactions with the IPSec controller:\\n* Each call to verify DNS resolution can take up to 6 mins 40 seconds to timeout since the network is unreachable.\\n\\n:::note\\nDuring normal operation this verification process ranges from a few hundred milliseconds to a few seconds.\\n:::\\n\\n* The watchdog, in an attempt to start the failed IPsec tunnel service, initiates another verify DNS resolution API call.\\n\\nDue to the delayed initialization of the WAN interfaces, the IPSec controller would get backed up with health-check tasks. This backlog prevented the forwarding plane from initializing the device interfaces. In the instance of the reproduction, there was a backlog of 9 hours before the API call from the forwarding plane could be processed. This was verified by letting the reproduction system stay in the stuck state for more than 9 hours. The device interfaces eventually updated the operational status of the Broadband interfaces.\\n\\n### Release Notes\\nResolved the startup race condition by enforcing stricter default timeouts for DNS operations.\\n\\n### Severity\\n<details>\\nThe potential impact of a software defect if encountered.

These operators treat the bits after the prefix length as 1s, so 147.161.128.0/17 should be equal to 147.161.254.0/23 (as an example). The container used in 5.6 uses the `operator<`. The container used in 6.1 takes a hash operator which is not hashing these equivalent net::IpMasks to be equal, hence the difference in behavior.\\n\\n### Release Notes\\nFix case where adding services with overlapping address prefixes would cause config to not apply in highway.\\n\\n### Severity\\n:::info\\nThe potential impact of a software defect if encountered.
