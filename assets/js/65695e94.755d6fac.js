When read from the table this alias also includes a series instance suffix, which represents a unique instance of metrics. In this context an instance of metrics represents one set of qualified metrics. For example the default CPU utlization metric has an alias "cpuUtilization" will be returned as "cpuUtilization_0".

The t128MetricValue is simply the current value of the metric. To understand the t128MetricContributors object requires a little more understanding of the way SSR metrics are stored and modelled. All metrics in SSR are assigned a "Metric ID" that is modeled in the YANG metrics data-model. This modelled metric ID is typically represented in a path like syntax, for example the CPU utilization metric id is "/stats/cpu/utilization". For a given metric there can be more than one series of data. For example with the "/stats/cpu/utilization" metric, on a system containing 4 CPU cores this metric will have 4 unique data series, one for each CPU core. The unique parameters that identify each data series are referred to as "contributors". There is always an implicit contributor which is the current router name and usually there is also a node contributor too as metrics are generally generated by a specific node (eg',":in"," the case of the CPU utilization each node will have its own 4 CPU cores). For the CPU metric the contributors are router, node and core and the t128MetricContributors object will contain a string representation of these values so that each row can be correlated with the correct metric data series."]}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.h2,{id:"configuration-file",children:"Configuration File"}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["The metrics configuration file is stored in ",(0,n.jsx)(t.code,{children:"/etc/128technology/snmpMetricsConfig.json"}),'.
