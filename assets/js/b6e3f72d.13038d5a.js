The goal is to create a list of global profiles that can be used for access policies to services. Conceptually, tenancy should not be tied to a location and should be a global construct available whenever we want to classify traffic to a profile when it enters the 128T fabric across the authority (though at times due to business logic defined by the customer, a tenant may reflect a location). At any point in the authority, when traffic ingresses into a 128T router, tenancy is applied. Typically this is done by assigning the tenant to the network-interface according to the purpose of the VLAN for which the 128T is the router. For example "POS" for point of sale, "voice" for telephony devices, and "core" for traffic coming from the customer\'s core network (if no further breakdown of tenancy is required for this traffic). The 128T router can also restrict ingress traffic into a tenant further by creating a neighborhood on the network interface. Neighborhoods serve multiple purposes and an additional discussion of neighborhoods will occur in an ensuing section. In the global tenant configuration, this neighborhood may be referenced as a "member" and then CIDR block ranges for source addresses can be defined within this member.

A service can be configured as generally as address 0.0.0.0/0 for the entire IPv4 address space or as specific as an individual /32 address and a single UDP or TCP port. These service configurations result in entries in the FIB table, which is what the 128T router uses to make forwarding decisions. In order for any traffic to pass through a 128T router, its source must be classified as belonging to a tenant, its destination needs to match a FIB entry for this tenant, and a next-hop must be available for this service traffic (more on this in the next section). If there are multiple service definitions that match the destination traffic for a tenant, the router will choose the most specific. Be careful, though, because a service configured with address 0.0.0.0/0 and a single port is considered to be more specific than a service configured with a /32 address and no port defined. Services that apply to different tenants can have the exact same definition and be given different treatment.

If traffic comes in that does not match a specific session-type, the 128T router will use default timers.

If the customer\'s application establishes a TCP socket that remains idle (without any keepalives) for longer than this value, the 128T router will remove the session from the session table. The next PDU that is attempted across this socket will receive an RST from the router (assuming transport-state-enforcement is set to the default "reset" in the service-policy).

Configuring each branch 128T to advertise its local network using BGPoSVR causes the data center router to create appropriate RIB entries to each peer's loopback. Taking this further, more specific branch services can be configured using the same address range and the specific protocol and port ranges of the service.

In order to avoid this, a "deny" service can be created using the aggregate branch address space just like in the example above, but by setting the tenants in the store to have an access-policy with permission "deny".

In this scenario, a service-route should not be used within the branch to influence the traffic out locally (or through an SFC IPsec tunnel).

If so, static IP (and subnet) information will need to be available in some database that can be queried in order to fill out the template.'),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"  Site Category   Physical (device) Interface name   Logical (network) Interface name   Vlan Number   IP addressing information"),(0,o.kt)("hr",null))}u.isMDXComponent=!0},69408:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/bcp_sdwan_design_1-cdb0a5533912c0e9121f7e0147148112.png"},99294:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/bcp_sdwan_design_2-2c92d9814367d3b6d6456ffc31028185.png"},5328:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/bcp_sdwan_design_3-fa327f0ec963c0a2db946c35155600b4.png"},5953:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/bcp_sdwan_design_4-e1d582eb85644f38d953bac2bb2f45a5.png"},98288:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/bcp_sdwan_design_5-f0d44ad1e9ba16639604124914bcb882.png"},27691:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/bcp_sdwan_design_6-03129dfd0d9648d81d13aa467ebf47cc.png"},54822:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/bcp_sdwan_design_7-b8d73f2c0a6ff7130287358c31e29e80.png"},36233:function(e,t,n){t.Z=n.p+"assets/images/bcp_sdwan_design_8-3c3eb999f3ac8bfa48683b8e55eff521.png"}}]);
