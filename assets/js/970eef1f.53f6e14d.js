Among these is a flexible and stable OS that natively supports a range of deployments from OEM hardware platforms, to hypervisors, to public cloud deployments. Using a supported, enterprise open source OS means that thousands of developers are monitoring millions of lines of code in the Linux kernel and other packages - finding flaws and developing fixes before vulnerabilities become problems.

Changes to the environment that impact the performance or reliability of the SSR software will not be covered under our support agreement. Changes made to the environment are not guaranteed to survive a software upgrade, and may need to be reapplied post-upgrade.
