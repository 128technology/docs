Just as with the Active/Standby model, you can elect to add a fabric interface \u2013 and in fact it is quite common to do so. (Without a fabric interface, only one ISP can be used at a time and it is arguably equivalent to an Active/Standby model.) With a fabric interface in place, the router will use the appropriate egress ISP based on the policies provisioned in the 128T, assuming all ISPs are active, which may mean that traffic arrives on one node and egresses via a separate node."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,'This model is advantaged over Active/Standby in that you get the benefit of "SD-WAN," able to leverage the best ISP path for a given type of traffic at any point in time.
