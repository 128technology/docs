It tells that Router that if you see traffic that matches one of your configured Services, then send it to the following destination. The destination can be one or more 128T Peers, a gateway, an IP address, a subnet, a blackhole, etc. If the destination is another 128T, then the 128Ts will use Secure Vector Routing to send the traffic.
