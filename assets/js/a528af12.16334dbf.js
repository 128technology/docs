If the deployment does not use the atop service, the rpm can be removed and in so doing emails will no longer be sent to the root user email. An example of the emails sent is: `Failed to try-restart atop.service: Unit is masked.`\n\n\n## Special Considerations\n\n- Validation has been added to prevent issues when destination service address and port ranges overlap with interface (waypoint) address and wayport ranges. If your configuration has an overlapping port range prior to the upgrade, you will now receive a validation error. The configuration must be remediated in order to make any additional changes. (I95-33556)\n\n- Support has been added to provision management interfaces.  Typically, these are Linux interfaces that are not part of the 128T configuration. These interfaces are called non-forwarding interfaces. It is strongly recommended that non-forwarding interfaces now be configured within the 128T.  When the Conductors are upgraded to 4.2.X, the configuration validation will provide a warning when non-forwarding interfaces are not configured for 128T routers configured in a HA pair. If non-forwarding interfaces are configured prior to upgrading the Conductors to 4.2.X, the shared or fabric device interface type must be explicitly set.  DHCP however is not supported. Note: 4.1.5 does not raise a validation error if the interface had DHCP. (I95-30831)\n\n- When creating non-forwarding interfaces on pre 4.2.0 routers, these interfaces should not be configured with default routes until after upgrading the routers to 4.2.0 or greater. (I95-30940)\n\n- Support has been added to allow the 128T Software to automatically determine the number of CPU forwarding cores that the router will use. In previous releases the "automatic/manual" parameter was not available and the core count was defined in environment config or within the UI. If set within the environment config (local.init), 4.2.X will set core count to automatic and determine the number of cores to use. If set in the UI, this parameter will be set to manual and the existing UI value will be used. Note that if automatic is set and the core count is changed in the PCLI, the change will be accepted as valid configuration but the automatic parameter will override as the automatic parameter takes precedence over the value in the forwarding core count. (I95-30884)\n\n- Prior to 4.1.5, peering with routers that have the same IP addresses was not supported. In 4.1.5 or greater remote peers having the same IP address is now supported in one direction, with the use of "outbound-only". 128T currently does not support ALL routers having the same IP address, the same IP address support is unidirectional.
