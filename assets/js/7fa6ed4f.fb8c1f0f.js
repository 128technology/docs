This is because each node does not know what calls the other node made while the split brain was occurring, so it is safer to make calls even if it may not be necessary. Consider the scenario where the primary node is active and the secondary node is inactive before a split brain. When the split brain occurs, the secondary will then become active. If this is with a solution like ",(0,i.kt)("inlineCode",{parentName:"p"},"azure-vnet"),", the last node to hit the API Agent will be the one that the solution point to. Thus the secondary node will be the active node from the Azure Route Table's perspective. Once the split brain is resolved, without the extra API calls, the primary would stay active without making any API calls and the secondary would become inactive. The problem with this is that the last node to trigger the API Agent was the secondary node so all branch bound traffic would be sent into interfaces that are provisionally down.
