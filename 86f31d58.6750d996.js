Secure Vector Routing (SVR) is a new routing architecture that enables the network to differentiate the way it delivers applications and services with simplicity, security, and scalability in mind. It replaces tunnel-based network overlays and inefficient provisioning systems with distributed control, simple intelligent service-based routing, and in-band (data plane) session-based signaling.
