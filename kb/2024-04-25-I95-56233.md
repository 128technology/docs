Packet forwarding on the SSR stops after several hours of runtime in AWS when using Elastic Network Adapter (ENA) driver.

<!-- truncate -->

**Issue ID:** I95-56233  
**Last Updated:** 2024-04-26  
**Introduced in SSR Version:** 6.1.7

### Problem
The ENA command-queue becomes unresponsive (device not responding) and the interface no longer passes traffic.

Indications of the symptoms can be observed by viewing the output of `show device-interface extended-statistics`.
There will be an excessive amount of rx errors indicated by the system.

### Release Notes
The ENA command-queue becomes unresponsive (device not responding) and the interface no longer passes traffic.

Updated ENA device driver from DPDK/Amazon (upgrading driver from 2.6.0 to 2.9.0).
[ENA release notes](https://github.com/amzn/amzn-drivers/blob/master/kernel/linux/ena/RELEASENOTES.md)

ENA supports health checks which can be used to detect faulty behavior of the hardware and the driver. As such, an ENA driver watchdog has been developed to check for the following reset reasons:

* HW unresponsiveness – Driver detected that the periodic keep alive signals stopped arriving from the HW through the Asynchronous Event Notification Queue (AENQ).
* Faulty admin queue behavior – The admin queue entered a faulty state.
* Faulty behavior on the IO path – The device returned invalid descriptors or caused the driver to enter the invalid state.
* Missing Tx completions exceeds a dynamically calculated threshold - Prevent Tx ring stalls in case Tx descriptors were not returned by the HW.

### Severity
<details>
The potential impact of a software defect if encountered. Severity levels are:
* Critical: Could severely affect service, capacity/traffic, and maintenance capabilities. May have a prolonged impact to the entire system.
* Major: Could seriously affect system operation, maintenance, administration and related tasks.
* Minor: Would not significantly impair the functioning or affect service.
</details>
Critical

### Status
Open

### Resolved In
6.2.6

### Product
SSR

### Functional Area
Datapath

### Workaround
:::info
Juniper may provide a method to temporarily circumvent a problem; workarounds do not exist for all issues.
:::
Disable enhanced networking in AWS instance.

A restart of the SSR is necessary to remediate this condition:
`systemctl restart 128T`
