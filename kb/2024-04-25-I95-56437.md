**Issue ID:** I95-56437  
**Last Updated:** 2024-04-25  
**Introduced in SSR Version:** 5.6.13

### Problem
The app-id and dscp-steering features are incompatible.  

If app-id is configured on a child service (application-name, domain-name, domain-name-category, url, subcategory) and also on the same service a dscp-range list is defined, this triggers a failure state when the configuration is committed, causing the service to be added/modified/removed twice during config processing (ServiceManager + AppIdManager).  The commit action fails, and any subsequent service config updates *within that failed config* are ignored.  

The administrator will not be aware of a configuration issue. The only indication of the failure are log messages, as shown below.
`highway.log`
```
Apr 17 13:59:54.622 [HWMC|SVC ] WARN  (routingAgPoller) ServiceAddException: Failed to Add Service Audio.MicrosoftTeams
Apr 17 13:59:54.622 [HWMC|SVC ] ERROR (routingAgPoller) ServiceManager failed to process config trackers
```

### Release Notes
The app-id and dscp-steering features are incompatible and should not be configured simultaneously; doing so will cause future commits to fail. Strict configuration validation has been added to prevent configuring both features simultaneously.
