Upgrade from 5.6.8 to 6.1.7 may result in missing FIB entries and service-paths, causing connectivity issues.


<!-- truncate -->

**Issue ID:** I95-55904  
**Last Updated:** 2024-04-24  
**Introduced in SSR Version:** 6.1.7

### Problem
The key of the data structure storing service configuration is a net::IpMask, which has custom `operator<`` and `operator==`` operator functions. These operators treat the bits after the prefix length as 1s, so 147.161.128.0/17 should be equal to 147.161.254.0/23 (as an example). The container used in 5.6 uses the `operator<`. The container used in 6.1 takes a hash operator which is not hashing these equivalent net::IpMasks to be equal, hence the difference in behavior.

### Release Notes
Fix case where adding services with overlapping address prefixes would cause config to not apply in highway.

### Severity
:::info
The potential impact of a software defect if encountered. Severity levels are:
* Critical: Could severely affect service, capacity/traffic, and maintenance capabilities. May have a prolonged impact to the entire system.
* Major: Could seriously affect system operation, maintenance, administration and related tasks.
* Minor: Would not significantly impair the functioning or affect service.
