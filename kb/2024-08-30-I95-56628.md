**Issue ID:** I95-56628  
**Last Updated:** 2024-05-02

### Problem

During an HA Conductor upgrade, the primary node upgrade completes successfully. The GUI then presents an option to continue with the secondary node upgrade. Initiating the secondary node from the GUI displays an error explaining that the resource could not be found. 

This issue has not been resolved and is currently under investigation. Please use the suggested workaround below.
