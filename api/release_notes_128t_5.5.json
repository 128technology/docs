{"content":"---\ntitle: SSR 5.5 Release Notes\nsidebar_label: '5.5'\n---\n:::info\nIssues resolved in a release are merged into subsequent releases chronologically AND numerically.\n\nIf you do not see an issue listed below, it may have been resolved in another recently released version. A link to the Release Notes for the most recent chronological release of SSR Software is provided.\n\nAlternatively, refer to the **[List of Releases](about_releases.mdx)** page for release dates and links to all SSR Release Notes; or, if you know the Issue ID Number, enter that into the Search field at the top right of this page.\n:::\n\n### Upgrade Considerations\n\n:::important\nBefore upgrading please review the [**Upgrade Considerations**](intro_upgrade_considerations.md) and the [**Rolling Back Software**](intro_rollback.md) pages. Several modifications have been made to the process for verifying configurations, which will impact existing configurations.\n:::\n\n- **I95-43243/IN-460 Upgrade and Rollback:** Upgrading or rolling back a system (conductor peer or router) with the interactive installer `install128t`, that is managed by a conductor may result in the system becoming unresponsive. It is highly recommended that upgrades be performed through the conductor UI. Manual upgrades and rollbacks may not be resilient to failures. See [Rolling Back Software](intro_rollback.md) for more information on these operations.\n------\n- **I95-42452 Conductor Upgrade Time:** Upgrades to version 5.4 and above can take up to 40 minutes due to the number of rpms being upgraded. Please plan accordingly.\n------\n- **I95-42624 Upgrade Installer:** Before **upgrading to, or installing** version 5.4 and above, update the Installer to at least version 3.1.0. Failing to upgrade the installer may result in a rollback failure, should a rollback be necessary at any time.\n------\n- **Plugin Upgrades:** If you are running with plugins, updates are required for some plugins **before** upgrading the conductor to SSR version 5.4.0 or higher. Please review the [Plugin Configuration Generation Changes](intro_upgrade_considerations.md#plugin-configuration-generation-changes) for additional information.  \n\n:::note\nThe Juniper SSR team does not publicly disclose known or resolved CVEs in our public documentation but instead utilizes our internal bug tracking IDs. Customers can obtain the actual CVE numbers by contacting Juniper Support.\n:::\n\n## Release 5.5.7-3\n\n**Release Date:** November 15, 2022\n\n### New Features\n\n- **I95-48223 Add Application-specific information to `show sessions by-id`:** The following information has been added to `show sessions by-id`: \n\t- domainName\n\t- uri\n\t- category\n\t- overrideServiceName\n\t- appStatsTrackingKey (combination of application, client ip, ingress-interface, next-hop, and traffic-class) \n\n### Resolved Issues:\n\n- **I95-32789 Peer metrics unavailable after Conflux synchronization:** Resolved an issue with HA routers where the metrics application stops streaming metrics to the peer node after loading configuration.\n------\n- **I95-43302 Rename Third-Party menu text:** The menu text has been changed to **External** to more accurately reflect the links to other Juniper platforms.\n------\n- **I95-45478 Segmentation Fault in the Dynamic Peer Update process:** Resolved an issue with multi-threaded access to a data member, leading to a segmentation fault.\n------\n- **I95-46677 Modify GUI to not resize dashboard tiles:** Dashboard tiles now do not resize when the window is resized.\n------\n- **I95-46904 Labels in Reachability Profile are not correct:** Added missing labels to Traffic Class and Time to Establishment information screens.\n------\n- **I95-47475 Session capture not downloadable for a read only user:** Adjusted permissions to provide access to session capture files to read-only users.\n------\n- **I95-47787 Worker core packet processing spikes to 100%:** Added the ability to tune the [Reverse Packet Session Resiliency](config_reference_guide.md#reverse-packet-session-resiliency) `Minimum Packet Count` (default is 3) and `Detection Interval` (default is 5) settings for session failover without requiring forward packet, and resolved the underlying issue that caused excessively high worker-core CPU.\n------\n- **I95-47909 Handle GRE tunnels in ICMP reachability probe:** The base interface for egress is now used if the `icmp-probe probe-address` is the same as the tunnel destination, and the `internal-address` is used as the source if the `egress-interface` is `gre-overlay`.\n------\n- **I95-48076 SSR Failover on GRE tunnels not working:** The base interface giid is now used to identify the state of a GRE tunnel next-hop.\n------\n- **I95-48108 Service Ping for a Service without Source NAT uses Source IP Address:** The service-ping now uses the source-ip as the packet source-ip if provided.\n------\n- **I95-48158 Unable to capture child services using session capture:** When a session capture is configured on a child service (e.g., `social.internet` instead of `internet`), the session is now recorded.\n------\n- **I95-48246 Peer path GQL query should provide a node filter:** Added a parameter to stats on peer-path so that the node can be overwritten.\n------\n- **I95-48353 Optimize Application-ID stats allocation:** Reduced memory usage by avoiding unnecessary app-id stats tracking allocations.\n------\n- **I95-48357 Process Fault on Failover with DSCP Steering:** Resolved an issue where DSCP Steering sessions would fail to move a flow under certain circumstances and, when using DSCP value 0, crash.\n------\n- **I95-483381 Race condition in session teardown:** Shared context is now maintained to allow all packet processing to be completed before session teardown. \n------\n- **I95-48507 VLAN packets are generated without a valid VLAN from the flow-move cache:** Resolved an issue where sessions could be modified incorrectly when a VLAN is present and session resiliency is enabled for failover.\n------\n- **I95-48685 GUI and/or PCLI unresponsive:** Resolved an issue where on an HA conductor the user interface would become unresponsive if a managed router was offline or unreachable.\n\n## Release 5.5.6-2\n\n:::important\nThe following issue has been discovered in the releases listed here:\n\n- 5.5.5\n- 5.5.6\n\nIf an HA Conductor queries a disconnected router from the Conductor GUI Router page or from the Conductor PCLI, the conductor may encounter periods of poor performance until the requests time out. The issue has been resolved in the next patch release with I95-48685. \n\nFor immediate resolution on the impacted releases, contact Juniper Technical Support, or your SE.\n:::\n\n**Release Date:** October 21, 2022\n\n### Resolved Issues:\n\n- **The following CVE's have been addressed and resolved:** I95-47805, I95-48048, I95-48049. \n------\n- **I95-39454 Created User cannot access PCLI operations:** Resolved an issue where in rare cases, during bulk user additions, it was possible for the operation to fail, leaving the new user created but unable to login.\n------\n- **I95-41992 Warning for Rate-Limit with Flow-Limit values at 0:** A warning has been added to advise users that this will cause dropped packets.\n------\n- **I95-42320 BGP aggregate-address not working:** Add support for BGP address summarization.\n------\n- **I95-44957 Azure is not able to identify the asset-id of the depolyed conductor and router:** The Azure ID has been modified to be more easily identifiable.\n------\n- **I95-44976 Highway issue when modifying an app-id session:** Resolved an issue where modifying an app-id session with a new session-id can lead to a crash.\n------\n- **I95-46701 Packet Loss on Headend Router:** Added `device-interface` rx/tx descriptor ring size to resolve this issue.\n------\n- **I95-46966 BGP Connection Restarts on SVR Peer Failover:** Resolved an issue with FIB entry setup that was causing BGP connection reset when the session fails over.\n------\n- **I95-47271 VRRP Alarm for Backup becoming Primary:** There is now an alarm when the backup VRRP node in an HA pair takes over as the primary.\n------\n- **I95-47552 LTE modem not coming up after upgrade:** Resolved an issue with modem detection and port scanning for Quectel EC25.\n------\n- **I95-47585 Transmit-failure increments when Traffic Engineering is enabled:** When `device-interface traffic-engineering` is enabled, the `stats/packet-processing/sent/interface-failure` statistic is no longer erroneously incremented.\n------\n- **I95-47767 Next Hop choice of \"Blackhole\" does not stay visible in Conductor:** This option was displayed in error, as the option is ignored. It has been removed.\n------\n- **I95-47872 App-ID summary tracking of failed sessions still incremented when feature disabled:** App-ID stats tracking for failed sessions now checks if the feature is enabled and responds appropriately.\n------\n- **I95-47967 Cloud bootstrapper does not bootstrap the deployed Conductor:** Resolved an issue where the configuration was being rejected by the cloud bootstrapper when the device was a conductor.\n------\n- **I95-47969 Increased Memory use when generating TSI:** Resolved an issue where the s`ave runtime-stats` command and TSI generation could result in particularly high memory usage when Application Identification was enabled.\n\n\tThe `save runtime-stats` command no longer operates across multiple nodes and routers, and will not aggregate the metrics to disk on the conductor. This is to protect against excessive memory consumption. This is a change in functionality; however the public metrics APIs achieve the same result and are the preferred mechanism to collect authority wide metrics.\n------\n- **I95-47981 Ignore VRRP advertisements if the VRID doesn't match:** The VRID is now validated before accepting an advertisement to resolv an issue where VRRP advertisements intended for a different router were being processed.\n------\n- **I95-48018 APP-ID implementation with proxy web server unable to identify traffic correctly:** Resolved an issue reading certain HTTP headers that was causing Application Identification to miss them.\n------\n- **I95-48103 Commit triggered BGP issue:** Resolved an issue where BGP neighbors configured with a short hold time might experience a BGP session flap during a configuration commit when app-ID is enabled.\n------\n- **I95-48125 Save TSI streaming from router to conductor not working:** Adding a node and router argument to the PCLI command `save tech-support-info` now works correctly.\n\n## Release 5.5.5-3\n\n**Release Date:** September 23, 2022\n\n### Resolved Issues:\n\n- **I95-48038 502 Error returned if managed routers are offline:** Resolved an issue introduced in Release 5.5.4-8 that caused HTTP requests on the conductor to return a 502 error for all requests if a managed router is offline.\n\n## Release 5.5.4-8\n\n**Release Date:** September 19, 2022\n\n:::important\nRelease 5.5.4-8 has been withdrawn from the Release Repository due to an issue identified shortly after release. This issue is being resolved and a new patch release will be forthcoming. \n:::\n\n\n### New Features\n\n- **I95-47418 Audit Events for Plugin Install/Remove:** There is a new audit event that tracks when a plugin is installed or uninstalled. This can be viewed on the Audit History page in the GUI or in the PCLI by running `show events type admin.plugin`\n\n### Resolved Issues\n\n- **The following CVE's have been addressed and resolved:** I95-47482, I95-47483, I95-47484, I95-47485.\n------\n- **I95-38408 DHCP server on wrong vlan sends offer in response to discover message:** Hosted DHCP servers that do not have an explicit vlan configured are now explicitly treated as vlan 0, and handle any DHCP packets that are untagged/vlan 0, in order to prevent those packets from being multicasted to multiple DHCP servers.\n------\n- **I95-44976 Highway issue when modifying an `app-id` session:** Resolved an issue where modifying an app-id session with a new session-id can lead to a crash.\n------\n- **I95-45847 Duplicate Alarms on Multiple Routers:** Resolved duplicate alarms by obtaining alarms from only one node in an HA pair.\n------\n- **I95-46126 Router Status:** Resolved an issue in HA configurations when a router is connected to HA Conductor 1, but not directly connected to HA Conductor 2, alarms generated on the router are now seen on Conductor 2 - the conductor to which the router is not directly connected. \n------\n- **I95-46281 Update Kernel to RHCK 8.6:** Updated the kernel to integrate the latest security fixes.\n------\n- **I95-46662 Tenant prefix differences on two HA router nodes are not validating correctly:** Added a validation check to ensure that the tenant-prefixes between two redundant interfaces are identical.\n------\n- **I95-46918 GUI and PCLI out of sync when new configuration elements added/modified:** Resolved an issue where `show network-interface` and `show config` were not updating properly.\n------\n- **I95-46919 LDAP Users Not Shown in GUI Users Display:** Updated username requirements and the ability to identify issues with usernames not meeting those requirements.

For more information, see [`clear app-id stats`](cli_reference.md#clear-app-id-stats).\n------\n- **I95-46747 Improved the Password user experience:** You now are re-prompted up to three times for the current password if it is incorrect. If a new password does not meet the strength check, you are prompted with that information, and required to update the password.\n\n### Resolved Issues\n\n- **I95-38408 DHCP server on wrong vlan sends offer in response to discover message:** Hosted DHCP servers that do not have an explicit vlan configured are now explicitly treated as vlan 0, and handle any DHCP packets that are untagged/vlan 0, in order to prevent those packets from being multicasted to multiple DHCP servers.\n------\n- **I95-44434 Peer metric sends IP of WAN interface instead of the expected string:** Logic has been added to show the available destination address.\n------\n- **I95-44548 Application Summary Sort Order:** Resolved an issue with the Application Summary sort order changing unintentionally.\n------ \n- **I95-45890 Service paths for BGP over SVR routes are not being rebuilt:** Resolved an issue when the vector configuration is changed on a network interface, the service paths for BGP over SVR routes are not being rebuilt. \n------\n- **I95-46056 `show ntp` has no output from PCLI, even though NTP is configured:** The output of show ntp will now report IP addresses of the time servers rather than resolve hostnames.\n------\n- **I95-46281 Kernel Update:** Update to RHCK 8.6 for the latest security fixes.\n------\n- **I95-46822 Revertible failover traffic not restored when reverse traffic is present:** For a \"revertible-failover\" service policy, when the preferred path is restored and a session no longer traverses an internode dogleg path, it was taking several seconds for traffic to be restored when forward traffic is present; in situations where only reverse traffic is present, traffic may not be restored. This issue has been resolved.\n------\n- **I95-46826 Carrier detection logic not recognizing disaster recovery modem:** Updated the carrier detection logic to properly recognize the carrier when a modem is attached to a disaster recovery cell tower.\n------\n- **I95-46931 Hardware using ConnectX6-DX fails to initialize:** Added support for this card variant.\n------\n- **I95-46933 `save-tech-support-info` creates a 0B file when manifest is missing:** This issue has been resolved and no file is created. \n------\n- **I95-47111 Issues with redundant interfaces on startup:** Resolved an issue where the notifications for active interfaces may get lost when using VRRP for redundancy.\n------\n- **I95-47129 Metadata is not disabled after flow-move for EoSVR sessions:** Added a metadata turnoff after session failover for EoSVR.\n------\n- **I95-47371 Config code generation changing enum values to lowercase:** Resolved an issue that prevented setting device interface `link-settings` to anything other than `auto`.\n\n## Release 5.5.2-5\n\n**Release Date:** June 30, 2022\n\n### New Features\n\n- **I95-40195 LDAP does not allow search base to be configured correctly:** Search base parameters, filter generation, certificate assurance, and logging enhancements have been added to the `ldap-server` configuration. See [LDAP](config_ldap.md) for more information.\n------\n- **I95-40333 Save credentials for accessing SSR software repositories:** `set software access-token` is a new PCLI command to save credentials for accessing SSR software repositories. This provides a way to run `install128t repo authenticate` without dropping to a linux shell. For additional information on this command, see [`set software access-token`](cli_reference.md#set-software-access-token).\n------\n- **I95-44863 Automatic Core Assignment after Reboot:** On systems where `forwarding-core-mode` is set to `automatic`, if the CPU core count changes the software will automatically recalculate the core count and allocation at reboot.\n------\n- **I95-46562 Allow targeting another router or node when saving tech-support-info:** GUI: A button has been added to the **Logs** page in the GUI to download a tech-support-info bundle. This allows downloading a router's `tech-support-info` directly from the Conductor GUI. <br />\nPCLI: The PCLI command `save tech-support-info` can now collect logs from another node. Using the Conductor's PCLI, a `tech-support-info` bundle can be collected from a Managed Router or the HA peer.\n\n### Resolved Issues\n\n- **The following CVE's have been addressed and resolved:** I95-45060, I95-45123, I95-45165, I95-46020, I95-46359.\n------\n- **I95-45126 Split-brain after the sync interface goes down:** Resolved an issue that if the SSR software experienced a crash while it owned an interface from an X553 device, other devices hosted by the same chip could be impacted.\n------\n- **I95-45814 No Bandwidth statistics visible in GUI:** Resolved an issue when processing high numbers of services and service routes which prevented a subset of stats from being stored and displayed.\n------\n- **I95-46114 SSR flooded with Highway messages:** The chatty `InterfaceMap::Exception: Unable to find path to peer` highway log has been suppressed.\n------\n- **I95-46136 Unused app-id stats not being purged fast enough:** Resolved an issue where app-id stats tracked per client, per app, per next-hop are not cleaned up when inactive.\n------\n- **I95-46169 RIB Doesn't Update Connected Route After Changing Network Interface Address Prefix from /24 to /27:** Resolved an issue when changing the prefix length for a network interface address, the RIB was not updated and routing protocols were not aware of the change.\n------\n- **I95-46314 Configuring Static Assignment with Client-Identifier Causes DHCP failure:** Updated config validation to verify that, within a single DHCP server host-service, all static assignments use unique client-identifiers.\n------\n- **I95-46332 VRRP Does Not Work with Ethernet Controller X710 for 10GbE SFP+:** Configuring VRRP on an Intel X700 series NIC can see discard broadcast packets due to the source pruning feature which is enabled by default. This change disables source pruning when VRRP is enabled on these NICs.\n------\n- **I95-46394 Conductor missing generated GIID's:** Resolved a rare case where the GIID on generated redundant interfaces was missing.\n------\n- **I95-46419 FEC w/ OutBound Only Fails:** Resolved an issue where FEC actions are not installed properly after the modifcation to resolve the outbound only path.\n------\n- **I95-46451 Active Node not updating properly:** Resolved an issue with inter-node VRRP wherein the virtual interface could get stuck in a bad state after a flap.\n------\n- **I95-46454 ICMP manager excessively logs ICMP echo replies with no matching context:** This issue has bee resolvd.\n------\n- **I95-46613 Flow move may not happen without forward packet for outbound only sessions:** Resolved an issue that when a session has been idle for more than 10 seconds, sessions for outbound-only connections may not failover properly without a forward packet.\n------\n- **I95-46641 Modem lockup after reset on dual LTE system:** This issue has been resolved. \n\n### Caveats\n\n- **I95-46822 Revertible failover traffic may not be restored when reverse traffic is present:** For a \"revertible-failover\" service policy, when the preferred path is restored and a session no longer traverses an internode dogleg path, it may take seconds for traffic to be restored when forward traffic is present; in situations where **only** reverse traffic is present, traffic may not be restored. This issue will be resolved in a future release.\n\n## Release 5.5.1-6\n\n**Release Date:** June 1, 2022\n\n### New Features\n\n- **I95-37417 Additional factory default session-type configuration:** Added factory-default session-types for NetBIOS Name Service, NTP, and LDAP over UDP.\n------\n- **I95-40130 Factory Defaults for Conductor Communication:** Added SaltStack, Conductor, and IKE default session-types.

Session modification has been addressed and collisions are now avoided.\n------\n- **I95-43779 DHCP IP Address is not released:** Updated the state machine to cause DHCP-enabled interfaces to send out a DHCP Request for their current IP address.\n------\n- **I95-43897 Planned failover did not work properly:** Resolved an issue where a waypoint missing from an internal database prevented failover.  \n------\n- **I95-44001 Peer uptime showing \"Unavailable\":** Peer path uptime now displays the correct values.\n------\n- **I95-44142 Automated Provisioner race condition:** Resolved a rare crash where applications would attempt to get information about already-closed sockets when responding to API requests.\n------\n- **I95-44443 NTP Server config not always picked up:** Resolved an issue where NTP configuration was changed but the backend would not take action on those changes.\n------\n- **I95-44551 DHCP Relay not working after upgrade:** A packet for traffic matching a summary service may be dropped because it was incorrectly flagged as hierarchical on the SVR peer. Well known non-hierarchical services such asDHCP relay will no longer perform hierarchical service checks on the peer.\n------\n- **I95-44554 Metadata packets may incorrectly pin flow affinity:** Worker core affinity latching has been prevented, resolving this issue. \n------\n- **I95-44722 Time based HMAC failure after HA reboot:** Resolved a buffering issue where device interfaces are now flushed upon becoming active to avoid handling of inactive packets.\n------\n- **I95-44726 Invalid return code returned by T1 card firmware creating a memory leak:** Resolved a buffer leak in the wanpipe driver.\n------\n- **I95-44730 Export event history exports only last 30 minutes:** Resolved an issue where `time` was captured, but never updated. \n------\n- **I95-44854 Extra \"Application\" column in Top Sessions panel:** The extra column has been removed. \n------\n- **I95-44988 SSR Stuck in Upgrade status:** Improved logging to detect when an installer session is started and there is an already an active interactive installer session; for example when an interactive installer session was left open.\n------\n- **I95-45113 snmp override of the IfTable:** An issue with SNMP reporting has been resolved.\n------\n- **I95-45124 RBAC Config Endpoints Leaking Information:** Resolved an issue where some configuration endpoints would allow users with incorrect permissions make requests.\n------\n- **I95-45171 Mist Service Route is not auto-generated when Mist WAN-Assurance is enabled by default:** This issue has been resolved.\n------\n- **I95-45348 Update salt master and minion to 3002.8:** This update resolves several CVE's and requires that the conductor must be running this release containing these fixes **before** upgrading a router. \n**Important** Please see the Caveat below for additional important information about HA upgrades.\n------\n- **I95-45374 Service-class with a rate-limit of 0 will drop traffic:** A warning is displayed if users configure a service-class to rate-limit but don't set max-flow-burst/max-flow-rate values (default is set to 0).\n------\n- **I95-45514 Only allow DSCP-steering config on forwarding interfaces:** DSCP Steering config no longer appears on non-forwarding interfaces.\n------\n- **I95-45541 LDAP users are unable to login to the PCLI due to permission errors:** This issue has been resolved.\n------\n- **I95-45696 Memory leak in PAM challenge library:** Resolved a memory leak in the PAM challenge library. \n------\n- **I95-45842 PCLI `show events` does not paginate correctly:** This issue has been resolved.\n------\n- **I95-45882 Rare case where an invalid DHCP server configuration generated:** This issue has been resolved.\n------\n- **I95-46055 Add warning when transmit caps are too low:** Users now get a warning when configuring a traffic-engineering transmit-cap under 1Mbps.\n------\n\n### Caveats\n\n- **I95-45348: Update salt master and minion to 3002.8:** When upgrading an HA pair to version 5.5.1, please be aware of the following: While updating the conductors in an HA pair, the upgraded conductor node asset state will remain DISCONNECTED if the active `automatedProvisioner` is not running a corrected version (see table below). When performing an HA conductor upgrade the node running the oldest software assumes leadership. However, the older version will not be able to talk to the new software on the upgraded conductor. \n\nThe active `automatedProvisioner` can be determined by running the command `show system processes`. Once the upgrade begins on the old node, the newly upgraded conductor takes over.\n\n#### Corrected Versions\n\n| Router Software Version | Minimum Required Conductor Version |\n| --- | --- |\n| 5.5.1 | 5.5.1, 5.6.0 |\n\n## Release 5.5.0-43\n\n**Release Date:** March 7, 2022\n\n### New Features\n\n- **I95-28791 Forward Error Correction:** Forward Error Correction (FEC) adds resiliency against packet loss between two points in the network.
