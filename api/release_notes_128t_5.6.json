A link to the Release Notes for the most recent chronological release of SSR Software is provided.\n\nAlternatively, refer to the **[List of Releases](about_releases.mdx)** page for release dates and links to all SSR Release Notes; or, if you know the Issue ID Number, enter that into the Search field at the top right of this page.\n:::\n\n### Upgrade Considerations\n\n:::important\nBefore upgrading please review the [**Upgrade Considerations**](intro_upgrade_considerations.md) and the [**Rolling Back Software**](intro_rollback.md) pages. Several modifications have been made to the process for verifying configurations, which will impact existing configurations.\n:::\n\n- **I95-43243/IN-460 Upgrade and Rollback:** Upgrading or rolling back a system (conductor peer or router) with the interactive installer `install128t`, that is managed by a conductor may result in the system becoming unresponsive. It is highly recommended that upgrades be performed through the conductor UI. Manual upgrades and rollbacks may not be resilient to failures. See [Rolling Back Software](intro_rollback.md) for more information on these operations.\n------\n- **I95-42452 Conductor Upgrade Time:** Upgrades to version 5.4 and above can take up to 40 minutes due to the number of rpms being upgraded. Please plan accordingly.\n------\n- **I95-42624 Upgrade Installer:** Before **upgrading to, or installing** version 5.4 and above, update the Installer to at least version 3.1.0. Failing to upgrade the installer may result in a rollback failure, should a rollback be necessary at any time. The Installer typically prompts you update when a new version is available. Select **Update** when prompted.\n------\n- **Plugin Upgrades:** If you are running with plugins, updates are required for some plugins **before** upgrading the conductor to SSR version 5.4.0 or higher. Please review the [Plugin Configuration Generation Changes](intro_upgrade_considerations.md#plugin-configuration-generation-changes) for additional information.  \n\n## Release 5.6.1-18\n\n**Release Date:** August 1, 2022\n\n### New Features\n\n- **I95-35610 Session Failover without a Forward Packet:** A keep-alive mechanism has been added for flow moves. When flow move is triggered, the SSR detects inactivity in forward traffic and generates a keep-alive packet in the forward direction.\n------\n- **I95-40195 LDAP does not allow search base to be configured correctly:** Search base parameters, filter generation, certificate assurance, and logging enhancements have been added to the `ldap-server` configuration. See [LDAP](config_ldap.md) for more information.\n------\n- **I95-40333 Save credentials for accessing SSR software repositories:** `set software access-token` is a new PCLI command to save credentials for accessing SSR software repositories. This provides a way to run `install128t repo authenticate` without dropping to a linux shell. For additional information on this command, see [`set software access-token`](cli_reference.md#set-software-access-token).\n------\n- **I95-43048 NIST FIPS Validated Cryptography:** FIPS Enforcement Mode has been added to the  package-based installation processes. Refer to [FIPS Enforcement Mode](intro_installation_bootable_media.md#fips-enforcement-mode) for details.\n------\n- **I95-43785 DSCP Tag Preservation:** When set to `true` the `preserve-dscp` command allows you to preserve DSCP values that have been set in a service class or received on a LAN-Interface, over an SVR path. See [DSCP Preservation](config_dscp_preservation.md) for more inforamation.\n------\n- **I95-44769 Add Linux system logs to the Tech Support Information data:** This patch allows for customizations of the systemd journal content included in the `tech-support-info` bundle, and includes additional default content.\n------\n- **I95-44863 Automatic Core Assignment after Reboot:** On systems where `forwarding-core-mode` is set to `automatic`, if the CPU core count changes the software will automatically recalculate the core count and allocation at reboot.\n------\n- **I95-44870 Mist Self-Registration and Onboarding:** Onboarding a Mist Managed SSR instance can be accomplished as part of the installation process. For details, refer to the steps to [Associate the Router with Mist](intro_installation_image.md#associate-the-router-with-mist) as part of the image-based installation. \n------\n- **I95-45670 BGP Conditional Advertisement:** When an SSR prefers a given provider for outbound traffic, it can now be configured to receive locally destined traffic specifically from that provider. For details and configuration information, see [BGP Conditional Advertisement.](config_bgp.md#bgp-conditional-advertisement)\n------\n- **I95-45679 Round trip time to packet acknowledgement:** A new TCP metric that samples round trip time from data sent to acknowledgement has been added.\n------\n- **I95-46562 Allow targeting another router or node when saving tech-support-info:** GUI: A button has been added to the **Logs** page in the GUI to download a tech-support-info bundle. This allows downloading a router's `tech-support-info` directly from the Conductor GUI. <br />\nPCLI: The PCLI command `save tech-support-info` can now collect logs from another node. Using the Conductor's PCLI, a `tech-support-info` bundle can be collected from a Managed Router or the HA peer.\n------\n- **I95-46747 Improved the Password user experience:** You now are re-propmpted up to three times for the current password if it is incorrect. If a new password does not meet the strength check, you are prompted with that information, and required to update the password. \n\n### Resolved Issues\n\n- **The following CVE's have been addressed and resolved:** I95-45054, I9-45056, I95-45059, I95-45060, I95-45165, I95-46020, I95-46359. \n------\n- **I95-35228 DHCP waypoint addresses not displayed on standby node in UI:** Resolved an issue where the PCLI logic was not matching the GUI Network Interface table.\n------\n- **I95-39274 DNS-based services kill asset connection resiliency:** Resolved an issue where an internal commit was bouncing the kni254 interface and causing a series of connection resets.\n------\n- **I95-42438 Save Tech Support tries to run when 128T service is down:** In situations where the PCLI is still active, but the 128T service is down, trying to run `save tech support` will appear to work, but does not return any info. This issue has been resolved, and will return a message when information is not retrievable. \n------\n- **I95-43606 No communication between Routers:** In rare instances the BFD Pinhole feature experienced collisions between forward session flows. Session modification has been addressed and collisions are now avoided.\n------\n- **I95-43779 DHCP IP Address not releasing appropriately:** When the cable is physically disconnected and reconnected from DHCP-enabled interfaces, the interfaces are now triggered to send out a DHCP Request for their current IP address.\n------\n- **I95-44001 Peer uptime showing \"Unavailable\":** Peer path uptime now displays the correct values.\n------\n- **I95-44548 Application Summary Sort Order:** Resolved an issue with the Application Summary sort order changing unintentionally.\n------\n- **I95-44551 DHCP Relay not working after upgrade:** A packet for traffic matching a summary service may be dropped because it was incorrectly flagged as hierarchical on the SVR peer.

This issue has been resolved.\n------\n- **I95-46931 Hardware using ConnectX6-DX fails to initialize:** Added support for this card variant.\n------\n- **I95-46959 PPPoE over VLAN not working when target interface is down:** Added code to bring up parent interface before VLAN interface.\n------\n- **I95-47111 Issues with redundant interfaces on startup:** Resolved an issue where the notifications for active interfaces may get lost when using VRRP for redundancy.\n\n## Release 5.6.0-44\n\n**Release Date:** May 20, 2022\n\n### New Features\n\n- **I95-10056 RADIUS support for Multi-Factor Authentication:** Integration between Radius user access and Role-based Access Control allows the SSR to support Multi-Factor Authentication using Yubikey. \n------\n- **I95-200118 Configuration Concurrency at Scale:** Support for multiple users concurrently editing the SSR configuration is now supported.

When performing an HA conductor upgrade the node running the oldest software assumes leadership. However, the older version will not be able to talk to the new software on the upgraded conductor. \n\nThe active `automatedProvisioner` can be determined by running the command `show system processes`. Once the upgrade begins on the old node, the newly upgraded conductor takes over.\n\n"}
