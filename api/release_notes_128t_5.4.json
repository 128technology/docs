{"content":"---\ntitle: SSR 5.4 Release Notes\nsidebar_label: '5.4'\n---\n:::info\nIssues resolved in a release are merged into subsequent releases chronologically AND numerically.\n\nIf you do not see an issue listed below, it may have been resolved in another recently released version. A link to the Release Notes for the most recent chronological release of SSR Software is provided.\n\nAlternatively, refer to the **[List of Releases](about_releases.mdx)** page for release dates and links to all SSR Release Notes; or, if you know the Issue ID Number, enter that into the Search field at the top right of this page.\n:::\n\n### Upgrade Considerations\n\n:::important\nBefore upgrading please review the [**Upgrade Considerations**](intro_upgrade_considerations.md) and the [**Rolling Back Software**](intro_rollback.md) pages. Several modifications have been made to the process for verifying configurations, which will impact existing configurations.\n:::\n\n- **I95-43243/IN-460 Upgrade and Rollback:** Upgrading or rolling back a system (conductor peer or router) with the interactive installer `install128t`, that is managed by a conductor may result in the system becoming unresponsive. It is highly recommended that upgrades be performed through the conductor UI. Manual upgrades and rollbacks may not be resilient to failures. See [Rolling Back Software](intro_rollback.md) for more information on these operations.\n------\n- **I95-42452 Conductor Upgrade Time:** Upgrades to version 5.4 can take up to 40 minutes due to the number of rpms being upgraded. Please plan accordingly.\n------\n- **I95-42624 Upgrade Installer:** Before **upgrading to, or installing** version 5.4, update the Installer to at least version 3.1.0. Failing to upgrade the installer may result in a rollback failure, should a rollback be necessary at any time.\n------\n- **Plugin Upgrades:** If you are running with plugins, updates are required for some plugins **before** upgrading the conductor to SSR version 5.4.0. Please review the [Plugin Configuration Generation Changes](intro_upgrade_considerations.md#plugin-configuration-generation-changes) for additional information.  \n\n## Release 5.4.3-8\n\n**Release Date:** January 27, 2022\n\n### New Features\n\n- **I95-39193 Extend Timeout after completion of three way handshake:** The TCP timer for the `initial-timeout` is now configurable per session-type.\n\n### Resolved Issues\n\n- **I95-33730 The `Completed in .* seconds` includes the time waiting for the user to confirm:** The execution time now only includes the time spent executing a command.  \n------\n- **I95-41108 EthoSVR doesn't restart the session when all peer paths are disabled:** This is not specific to EthoSVR and can happen to any session that is unidirectional.
