## One Touch Provisioning (OTP)

The OTP installation process produces a system installed with 128T software with factory defaults. A unique [Quickstart](intro_ztp.md) file generated by the Conductor for the 128T will be used to deliver the encoded configuration. The User must connect to the 128T via ethernet cable and use the Quickstart file to finalize the 128T configuration. After performing the QuickStart operation, the 128T it will have connectivity to the Conductor to download the latest configuration (if necessary) and begin operation.
