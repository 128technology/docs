## Conductor Installation
<LinuxComplete/>

### Initial Boot and NMTUI
<InitialBoot/>

### Configure the Network Interface 
<ConductorIP/>

### Initialize the SSR Node

The SSR Initializer tunes your operating system, prepares the platform to run the SSR software, and creates the bootstrapping files necessary to load the software. The Initializer is launched on first boot.

There are three different types of conductor installations; 
- [Standalone Conductor](single_conductor_install.mdx)
- Conductor High Availability
- [Conductor High Availability for Cloud Deployments](intro_initialize_HA_conductor.md)

## Install the First Conductor HA Node 

1. On the SSR Initializer wizard screen, use the space bar to select the **Conductor** role for the SSR node, and press the **Enter** key to select **OK**.

2. When asked _What kind of Router/Conductor node is this?_, select **1st HA Node**:

  ![Identify the Node](/img/initializer_Serial3.png)

- **1st HA Node:** This conductor is the first node of a high availability pair. You will be prompted to provide the local IP address for this node. The 2nd HA node will contact this node at the address provided to synchronize state. Note: The 1st Node IP address must be reachable by the 2nd HA Node.
  
- **2nd HA Node:** This conductor is the second node of a high availability pair, where the first node has been initialized. You will be prompted to provide the 1st Node IP address for this 2nd node that will be used to synchronize state. Note: The 2nd Node IP address must be reachable by the 1st HA Node.

4. The following steps configure a high availability conductor node.

  a). Enter the IP address of the local HA sync interface. 

    ![High Availability IP Address](/img/initializer_Serial3HAIP.png)

  b). Enter the following system properties on the **Node Info** screen:

    ![Node Information](/img/initializer_Serial5.png)

    - **Node Name:** The name of the system within your SSR Router or Conductor, for example, _conductor_. By default this field uses the Linux system's hostname.

    :::note
    Both routers and conductors can consist of one node (for standalone systems) or two nodes (for highly available systems).
    :::

    - **Conductor Name:** The name of the Conductor system as a whole. When referring to a running SSR software instance, it is identifiable by the full name; e.g., `conductor-node1.conductor`. The full system name is reflected in the PCLI prompt.

5. On the **Password Setup** screen, create a password for the SSR Admin user. The administrator password must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least 1 uppercase letter, at least 1 lowercase letter, at least 1 number, cannot contain the username in any form, and cannot repeat characters more than 3 times. This operation is only performed on the standalone or first node in the HA peer, and the password must be entered twice. 
  :::note
  Resetting a password requires entering the old password. If a password is lost or forgotten and the account is inaccessible, the account cannot be recovered. Please keep password records accessible and secure. 
  :::

6. Press the **Enter** key to select **OK**. The Initializer performs a hardware compatibility check. The compatibility check may fail due to warnings or failure notices, which are displayed in the output script. If no failures are present, you can choose to continue with the installation even if multiple warnings exist. For information on why a specific test may have failed or generated a warning, contact Juniper Technical Support.

7. When prompted, select `<Yes>` to start the conductor.

  :::note
  If installing the SSR software for the first time, a system reboot is required.

## Install the Second Conductor HA Node

For the second node for Conductor HA, install the system using the same process beginning with [Installing the ISO](intro_installation_bootable_media.mdx#installing-the-iso) and ending at [Initialize SSR](intro_installation_bootable_media.mdx#initialize-the-128t-node) step 2. From step 2, perform the following:

1. When prompted for `What kind of Conductor node is this?` Select the **2nd HA Node**.

  ![2nd HA Node Setup](/img/initializer_Serial4cHANode.png)

2. Enter the **HA Address** and **Peer HA Address** for the second node. The HA Address is the local 2nd HA Node IP address, and the Peer HA Address is the 1st HA Node IP address.

  ![2nd HA Peer IP](/img/initializer_Serial4dHANode.png)

3. Enter the **HA Peer Credentials**. This is a one time operation for the initialization of the second HA Node with the first HA Peer. The `t128` user can be used for this operation.

  ![HA Peer Credentials](/img/initializer_Serial4eHAPeer.png)

4. Press the **Enter** key to select **OK**. The Initializer performs a hardware compatibility check. The compatibility check may fail due to warnings or failure notices, which are displayed in the output script. If no **failures** are present, you can choose to continue with the installation even if multiple warnings exist. For information about why a specific test may have failed or generated a warning, contact Juniper Technical Support.

5. After the initialization process completes the setup, the following screen displays. Use the Enter key to select `Got it!`

6. When prompted, select `<Yes>` to start the conductor.

## Verify the Installation
<VerifyConductorInstall/>

## Configure the Token

To save repository access credentials, use the PCLI command `set software access-token`. For information on this command, see [`set software access-token`](cli_reference.md#set-software-access-token).

From the root user in the workflow above, run the `pcli` command to access the PCLI and configure the token.

```
[root@test-conductor ~]# pcli
Starting the PCLI...
root@node1.test-conductor# set software access-token <username> <password>

## Add the Conductor to the Authority

Take this opportunity to log into the Conductor GUI to complete the following operations. This will provide validation that the installation was successful, and familiarize you with GUI operations. 

1. Select the **Conductor** from the Authority menu on the left side of the GUI. 

 ![Configuration menu](/img/config_menu_gui.png)

2. Select the **Configure** icon.

 ![Conductor Configuration Icon](/img/conductor_config_icon.png)

3. Select the node for the conductor - in this example it is `node1`.

 ![Conductor Node](/img/conductor_node.png) 

4. Under **Associated Asset ID** select the hostname for the conductor.

 ![Asset ID](/img/conductor_asset-id.png)

5. Validate and Commit the changes to the configuration. 

### Set the Authority Name

The authority represents the complete set of all SSRs managed under a single organizational entity.

1. Return to the Authority level
2. Select the Authority Settings.

 ![Authority Settings](/img/conductor_authority_name.png)

3. Under Basic Information, enter the new Authority name.

 ![Basic Information](/img/conductor_authority_name2.png)

### Set the Conductor IP Address for each Node

1. Under Conductor Addresses, select ADD.
2. In the **New Conductor Address** window, enter the conductor public IP address.

![Conductor Address](/img/conductor_address.png)

3. Click Validate and Commit. Warnings will appear, advising you of the change.  

### Next Steps - Router Configuration

Congratulations, you have successfully installed and configured a conductor! The next step is to optimize the router onboarding process. Creating router configurations on the conductor allows individual routers to download the necessary configuration to get up and running smoothly. 

A sample branch router configuration is available as a [**template**](config_templates.md#default-templates) on the conductor. This is a great place to start the configuration process. Additionally, you can create configuration templates that allow administrators to automate the configuration of top level resources. For more information, see [Configuration Templates](config_templates.md).
