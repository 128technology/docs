## Choose the Installation Type

:::note
Conductor installations are not supported by the OTP Install process. Please use the Interactive Install on either the VGA or the Serial console.

## Conductor Installation
<LinuxComplete/>

### Initial Boot and NMTUI
<InitialBoot/>

### Configure the Network Interface 
<ConductorIP/>

### Initialize the Conductor Node

The SSR Initializer tunes your operating system, prepares the platform to run the SSR software, and creates the bootstrapping files necessary to load the software. The Initializer is launched on first boot.

There are three different types of conductor installations; 
- [Standalone Conductor](single_conductor_install.mdx)
- Conductor High Availability
- [Conductor High Availability for Cloud Deployments](intro_initialize_HA_conductor.md)

## Install the First Conductor HA Node 

Use the following diagram as a reference during the HA installation.

![SSR1300 HA Config](/img/conductor_ha_install.png)

1. On the SSR Initializer wizard screen, use the space bar to select the **Conductor** role for the SSR node, and press the **Enter** key to select **OK**.

2. When asked _What kind of Router/Conductor node is this?_, select **1st HA Node**:

  ![Identify the Node](/img/initializer_Serial3.png)

- **1st HA Node:** This conductor is the first node of a high availability pair. You will be prompted to provide the local IP address for this node. The 2nd HA node will contact this node at the address provided to synchronize state. Note: The 1st Node IP address must be reachable by the 2nd HA Node.
  
- **2nd HA Node:** This conductor is the second node of a high availability pair, where the first node has been initialized. You will be prompted to provide the 1st Node IP address for this 2nd node that will be used to synchronize state. Note: The 2nd Node IP address must be reachable by the 1st HA Node.

3. The following steps configure a high availability conductor node.

  a). Enter the IP address of the local HA sync interface. 

    ![High Availability IP Address](/img/initializer_Serial3HAIP.png)

  b). Enter the following system properties on the **Node Info** screen:

    ![Node Information](/img/initializer_Serial5.png)

    - **Node Name:** The name of the system within your SSR Router or Conductor, for example, _conductor_. By default this field uses the Linux system's hostname.

    :::note
    Both routers and conductors can consist of one node (for standalone systems) or two nodes (for highly available systems).
    :::

    - **Conductor Name:** The name of the Conductor system as a whole. When referring to a running SSR software instance, it is identifiable by the full name; e.g., `conductor-node1.conductor`. The full system name is reflected in the PCLI prompt.

4. On the **Password Setup** screen, create a password for the SSR Admin user. The administrator password must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least 1 uppercase letter, at least 1 lowercase letter, at least 1 number, cannot contain the username in any form, and cannot repeat characters more than 3 times. This operation is only performed on the standalone or first node in the HA peer, and the password must be entered twice. 
  :::note
  Resetting a password requires entering the old password. If a password is lost or forgotten and the account is inaccessible, the account cannot be recovered. Please keep password records accessible and secure. 
  :::

5. Press the **Enter** key to select **OK**. The Initializer performs a hardware compatibility check. The compatibility check may fail due to warnings or failure notices, which are displayed in the output script. If no failures are present, you can choose to continue with the installation even if multiple warnings exist. For information on why a specific test may have failed or generated a warning, contact Juniper Technical Support.

6. When prompted, select `<Yes>` to start the conductor.

  :::note
  If installing the SSR software for the first time, a system reboot is required.

### Set the Conductor IP Address for each Node

## Install the Second Conductor HA Node

For the second node for Conductor HA, install the system using the same process beginning with [Installing the ISO](intro_installation_bootable_media.mdx#installing-the-iso) and ending at [Initialize SSR](intro_installation_bootable_media.mdx#initialize-the-128t-node) step 2. From step 2, perform the following:

1. When prompted for `What kind of Conductor node is this?` Select the **2nd HA Node**.

  ![2nd HA Node Setup](/img/initializer_Serial4cHANode.png)

2. Enter the **HA Address** and **Peer HA Address** for the second node. The HA Address is the local **2nd HA Node** IP address, and the Peer HA Address is the **1st HA Node** IP address.

  ![2nd HA Peer IP](/img/initializer_Serial4dHANode.png)

3. Enter the **HA Peer Credentials**. This is a one time operation for the initialization of the second HA Node with the first HA Peer. The `t128` user is a good choice for this operation, using the default username and password. Be sure to change this password after the installation of the second HA node.

:::note
This operation has no impact on future changes to users and passwords. Once HA is established between conductor nodes, security keys are exchanged for secure communication.
:::

4. Press the **Enter** key to select **OK**. The Initializer performs a hardware compatibility check. The compatibility check may fail due to warnings or failure notices, which are displayed in the output script. If no **failures** are present, you can choose to continue with the installation even if multiple warnings exist. For information about why a specific test may have failed or generated a warning, contact Juniper Technical Support.

5. After the initialization process completes the setup, the following screen displays. Use the Enter key to select `Got it!`

6. When prompted, select `<Yes>` to start the conductor.
