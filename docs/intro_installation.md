## Introduction
Welcome to 128T - the first software-based routing solution designed to be both session-oriented and service-centric through the application of Secure Vector Routing. The purpose of this guide is to provide an overview and installation walkthrough for the 128T Router and 128TÂ Conductor products into a Linux operating system environment. This product suite is collectively known as 128T Routing Software.

## Before You Begin
Before you begin the installation and configuration of 128T Routing Software, you must:
- Be familiar with Linux fundamentals, basic network addressing, and IP networking terminology. 
- Be a system administrator to perform the installation and configuration.
- Have root access to the target machine, or have an entry in /etc/sudoers allowing you to execute Linux shell commands as root (via sudo).

:::note
The examples listed in this guide generally prefer running commands as a non-root user, except as noted, and prepend commands that must be run as a superuser with sudo.
