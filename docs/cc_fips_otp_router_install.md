title: OTP Router Install Process
sidbar_label: OTP Router Install Process
--- 

The simplest deployment of the One Touch Provisioning (OTP) solution is highly automated and leverages just two components, the Conductor and at least one SSR. For many customers, the SSR platform is ordered and delivered as a pre-integrated, off-the-shelf solution through the Juniper SSR partner network. 

The OTP installation process produces a Router installed with SSR software set to factory defaults. Upon completing the OTP installation process, the default behavior is to provision the device with a DHCP client on the first ethernet port and DHCP server listening on all other ports. The user connects to the SSR via ethernet cable and uses the QuickStart file generated by the Conductor to finalize the SSR configuration. After performing the QuickStart operation, the SSR has connectivity to the conductor and downloads the latest configuration (if necessary) to begin operation.

This process assumes you have already created a bootable device using a USB. Instructions for downloading and creating a bootable device are available in [Downloading an SSR ISO](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/session-smart-router/docs/intro_downloading_iso) and [Creating a Bootable USB](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/session-smart-router/docs/intro_creating_bootable_usb).

Router installation can be performed using **either** the OTP process here, or the [Interactive Installation](cc_fips_router_install.md). You do not need to perform both. **The steps in this section describes the OTP process.**

:::note
The Conductor installation must be completed before installing a Session Smart Router or routers using the ISO. The same ISO is used for all installations.
:::

### QuickStart Provisioning
Basic configuration parameters are encoded within an encrypted file. For each node, a custom file can be exported from the Conductor and minimally contains the following configuration encoded parameters:
- WAN IP address, subnet mask and gateway
- Conductor IP address
- Asset ID

### Before you Begin

Before beginning the Router installation, you must have a Conductor operationally deployed and reachable by the router.

## Installation

### Connect the SSR to a Management Console

Ensure that you have an appropriate rollover cable available to connect to your computer. The SSR has a console port (CONSOLE) with an RJ-45 connector. Use the console port to connect the appliance to a management console or to a console server. The default baud rate of the console port is 115200 bps.

1. Connect the RJ45 rollover cable to the console port on the SSR device.
2. Connect the other end of the cable to your computer.
3. Insert your USB with the new ISO image into the USB port of the SSR device.
4. Connect the power input to the SSR device
5. Power on the SSR. 

### Booting from the USB

Use the steps appropriate for your device to direct the device to boot from the USB for installation. 

#### SSR100 Series Devices

1. At the instruction in the terminal window: `Press ESC for boot menu`, do so.

4. Press Enter to confirm boot from the USB device.
5. When the USB installer boot menu is displayed, continue with the [OTP Router Installation](#otp-router-installation).

### OTP Router Installation 

Upon boot, the following screen is displayed. The default selection is booting to the serial console (115200 baud). You must manually choose the installation process suited for your environment.

1. Use the Up/Down keys to select the `OTP Install 128T Routing Software Serial Console` option. This is a supported installation option for Common Criteria. It uses `/dev/ttyS0` 115200 baud as the serial console for interacting with the installer. 

  ![Serial Install Selection](/img/cc_fips_otp_serial.png)

  Selecting the wrong type of console may result in garbled characters being displayed. If allowed to continue it will result in an incorrect installation. If the wrong console is selected, reboot the target system and select the correct line for the target hardware.

  For serial console issues please refer to [Serial Console Troubleshooting](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/session-smart-router/docs/ts_serial_console_tsing).

2. Press the TAB key to edit the configuration.

  To enable FIPS Enforcement for SSR software version 6.2.3-14R2, add the `fips=1` kernel option  to the kernel command line during system installation as shown in the steps below. This ensures that key generation is done with FIPS approved algorithms and continuous monitoring tests in place.

  :::important
  FIPS mode is required for Common Criteria compliance. Failure to configure FIPS mode, or the use of any other cryptographic engine nullifies compliance.
  :::

3. Add `fips=1` to the end of the `vmlinuz` parameters.

4. Press **Enter** to start the install. 

### SSR Installation

This installation process is an automated workflow which does not require user interaction after selecting and initiating the OTP menu option. The system will power off after installation.

### Root Access
To permit root access to the SSR system, ensure that there is at least one user configured on each system with super user (sudo) privileges. Failure to do so may result in the loss of management connectivity to the router. 
**SSH Root login is not permitted.**

Prerequisites for installation and upgrades now include configuring a super user in /etc/sudoers that is allowed to execute Linux shell commands as root (sudo privileges).
During an upgrade, if the existing version allows SSH Root login, it will be disabled. When a system is installed using the OTP ISO, a "t128" user is automatically configured with sudo privileges. 

1. Login using the admin credentials. 
2. Enter the Linux shell: Type `shell` to suspend the PCLI and enter the Linux shell. 
3. Type `su` and enter the default root password. 
4. Use the following command to grant sudo privilege to the `admin` user account: 
 `/usr/sbin/visudo` 
5. Add an entry for admin as follows: 
 ```
 admin    ALL=(ALL)      ALL
 ```
6. Save the file and exit from `visudo`.
7. Type `exit` to leave the `su` prompt. 

### Change the Default Passwords

The following user accounts and passwords are created during the ISO installation process:

| Username | Password   |
| -------- | ---------- |
| root     | 128tRoutes |
| t128     | 128tRoutes |

Change these passwords immediately. Use the `passwd` command from the Linux shell to individually set the password for each username. 

```
[admin@localhost ~]$ sudo passwd t128
Changing password for user t128
New password:
Retype new password: 
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
[admin@localhost ~]$ sudo passwd root 
Changing password for user root.
New password:
Retype new password: 
passwd: all authentication tokens updated successfully.
[admin@localhost ~]$
```

:::note
The root account will not be used for day-to-day access, but the root account password should be stored securely off-box so that it can be used for admin account recovery if required. 
:::

### Software Compliance Validation

After installing the SSR Software it is important to verify that the installation was completed successfully, and that the system is running in the FIPS enforcing mode required for Common Criteria compliance. After starting the SSR router or conductor, the login screen appears on the console. 
Alternatively you may ssh to the SSR management IP address using the admin account. 

1. Login using the admin credentials. 
2. Use `show system version`  to verify the correct software release is running: 

```
Last login: Thu Dec 14 13:28:36 UTC 2023 on pts/0
admin@conductor.conductor# show system version
Fri 2024-03-01 16:23:37 UTC
✔ Retrieving system version 1/1 targets complete...

=========== =========== ========= ======== ====================== =====================
 Router      Node        Version   Status   Build Date             Package

                                                                   7 (package based)

Completed in 0.05 seconds
admin@conductor.conductor#
```
 It should report Version 6.2.3 and Status r2.
 
3. Type `shell` to suspend the PCLI and enter the Linux shell. 
4. Execute the command `sudo systemctl status 128T` and verify the service is listed as `active (running)`.

```
[root@conductor-test admin]# sudo systemctl status 128T -l
 128T.service - 128T service
  Loaded: loaded (usr/lib/systemd/system/128T.service; enabled; vendor preset: disabled)
  Active: active (running) since Mon 2023-7-31 18:04:29 UTC; 50min ago
 Main PID: 23317 (processManager)
```
 
5. Perform the following steps to verify the software integrity and protect against future tampering: 
 
- `sudo systemctl start 128T-rpm-verify` 
 
- The self-test scan is intiated and takes approximately two minutes to complete. Upon completion, run: 

 `systemctl status 128T-rpm-verify` 

 Successful completion displays the following message:

 `PASS: All RPM file digests verified`
 
- If the result displays the following:

 `FAIL: RPM file digest mismatch detected`

 The failure must be resolved before continuing to ensure compliance. The full path to each file having a self-check digest mismatch is reported as part of the `status` output. 
 
- After the self-test scan test has succeed, enable the automatic self-test by executing the `enable` command in the linux shell:

 `systemctl enable 128T-rpm-verify`

 The self-test is enabled on every subsequent reboot. If the self-test fails, the 128T service will not start.  
 
6. Perform the following steps to verify that FIPS security enforcment mode is enabled in the OS:
 `openssl md5 /dev/null` 
 Expected result:  `digital envelope routines … Disabled for fips` 

7. Run the following command to verify that FIPS security enforcing mode is enabled in the kernel: 
 `cat /proc/sys/crypto/fips_enabled` 
 Expected result:  `1`  

8. Type `exit` to leave the Linux shell and return to the PCLI. 
9. Type `quit` to log out from PCLI. 

You have now completed security validation of the installation. 

### PCLI Access Post Install

Use the following procedure to access the PCLI at any time after installation. 

1. Open a terminal window and SSH to the SSR's IP address. 
2. Use your login credentials to log in to the SSR 
 
 - If using an account other than admin, type `pcli` to start the SSR PCLI. 

 - Type `shell` to suspend the PCLI and enter the Linux shell.  

To terminate an active session: 

- Type `exit` to return from the Linux shell to the PCLI. 

- Type `quit` to log out from PCLI.

- If using an account other than admin, type `exit` to end the login session. 

Common Criteria certiﬁcation does not require any restrictions on executing commands. See the [Conﬁguration Command Reference Guide](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/session-smart-router/docs/config_command_guide) for command information and usage.
