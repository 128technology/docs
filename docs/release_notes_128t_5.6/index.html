Several modifications have been made to the process for verifying configurations, which will impact existing configurations.</p></div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-43243/IN-460 Upgrade and Rollback:</strong> Upgrading or rolling back a system (conductor peer or router) with the interactive installer <code>install128t</code>, that is managed by a conductor may result in the system becoming unresponsive. It is highly recommended that upgrades be performed through the conductor UI. Manual upgrades and rollbacks may not be resilient to failures. See <a href="/docs/intro_rollback">Rolling Back Software</a> for more information on these operations.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-42452 Conductor Upgrade Time:</strong> Upgrades to version 5.4 and above can take up to 40 minutes due to the number of rpms being upgraded. Please plan accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-42624 Upgrade Installer:</strong> Before <strong>upgrading to, or installing</strong> version 5.4 and above, update the Installer to at least version 3.1.0. Failing to upgrade the installer may result in a rollback failure, should a rollback be necessary at any time. The Installer typically prompts you update when a new version is available. Select <strong>Update</strong> when prompted.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plugin Upgrades:</strong> If you are running with plugins, updates are required for some plugins <strong>before</strong> upgrading the conductor to SSR version 5.4.0 or higher. Please review the <a href="/docs/intro_upgrade_considerations#plugin-configuration-generation-changes">Plugin Configuration Generation Changes</a> for additional information.</li>

Anything to be ignored during validation now triggers a config warning.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55949 Silicom Valencia Atom C1130 CPU flags are not properly detected:</strong> Resolved an issue where the <code>cpuinfo</code> parser fails due to a collision between the processor key name and value - the Silicom Valencia model name in the <code>cpuinfo</code> contains the word <code>processor</code>.</li>

<li><strong>I95-56492 Sessions configured for outbound-only with nat-keep-alive enabled experience reverse flow packet drops after flow migration:</strong> A flow move from a WAN path to an inter-router path causes repeated session modifies on the hub side causing reverse traffic packet drops due to NAT keepalives incorrectly testing the failed WAN path for the migrated session. This issue has been resolved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-56541 Include kernel journal entries in TSI:</strong> A separate <code>kernel.log</code> journal file is now created in the TSI output.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>

<li><strong>The following CVE&#x27;s have been identified and addressed in this release:</strong> CVE-2022-41974, CVE-2023-32360, CVE-2023-22045, CVE-2023-22049, CVE-2022-41741, CVE-2022-41742, CVE-2020-12321, CVE-2023-2650, CVE-2023-3446, CVE-2023-3817, CVE-2023-3341, CVE-2023-22081, CVE-2022-0934, CVE-2023-46847, CVE-2021-43975, CVE-2022-28388, CVE-2022-3594, CVE-2022-3640, CVE-2022-38457, CVE-2022-40133, CVE-2022-40982, CVE-2022-42895, CVE-2022-45869, CVE-2022-45887, CVE-2022-4744, CVE-2023-0458, CVE-2023-0590, CVE-2023-0597, CVE-2023-1073, CVE-2023-1074, CVE-2023-1075, CVE-2023-1079, CVE-2023-1118, CVE-2023-1206, CVE-2023-1252, CVE-2023-1382, CVE-2023-1855, CVE-2023-1989, CVE-2023-1998, CVE-2023-23455, CVE-2023-2513, CVE-2023-26545, CVE-2023-28328, CVE-2023-28772, CVE-2023-30456, CVE-2023-31084, CVE-2023-3141, CVE-2023-31436, CVE-2023-3161, CVE-2023-3212, CVE-2023-3268, CVE-2023-33203, CVE-2023-33951, CVE-2023-33952, CVE-2023-35823, CVE-2023-35824, CVE-2023-35825, CVE-2023-3609, CVE-2023-3611, CVE-2023-3772, CVE-2023-4128, CVE-2023-4132, CVE-2023-4155, CVE-2023-4206, CVE-2023-4207, CVE-2023-4208, CVE-2023-4732, CVE-2022-45884, CVE-2022-45886, CVE-2022-45919, CVE-2023-1192, CVE-2023-2163, CVE-2023-3812, CVE-2023-5178, CVE-2023-38406, CVE-2023-38407, CVE-2023-47234, CVE-2023-47235.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-38188 Re-Homing an SSR in certain circumstances leaves residual services:</strong> If an SSR is rehomed from an HA conductor to a standalone conductor, the services pointing to the second node of the HA conductor were not removed. Resolved the issue where the reverse SSH tunnels from a managed router to the second HA conductor node were not cleaned up if the conductor was converted back to a standalone conductor.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-48783 Conductor process logs are unbounded, risking storage exhaustion:</strong> <code>auditd</code> logs consuming the disk space when the node monitor is in a disconnected state and the audit logs are left unconsumed. There was a limit to the log file size, but not the number of files. The number of files is now limited.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50493 Memory calculation for alarms is confusing:</strong> This alarm was designed to trigger when memory usage went above 90% and clear only when memory usage went below 80%, causing confusion. The memory usage alarm no longer requires memory usage to go below 80% to clear; it will clear when memory usage goes below 90%.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50540 Denied traffic events not displaying in the GUI or PCLI:</strong> Resolved an issue that prevented displaying denied traffic events in the <code>show events</code> PCLI command and in the GUI. Users would see <code>% Error: Unhandled TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices</code> in the PCLI, and <code>An unknown traffic event occurred</code> in the GUI.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51191 BFD metrics not cleaned up properly:</strong> The BFDAgent holds onto the stats for peer paths; If the config is changed on a router, new stats are made but the old ones were not being deleted. The old BFD by-peer-path stats are now deleted when a VLAN configuration change is made.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51459 Logs and exception pcaps are periodically filled with error logs and truncated packets:</strong> Resolved an issue where ICMP error respond packets for encapsulated traffic caused <code>PacketBufferDataNotFound: Could not find specified data in packet</code> error logs to be generated, or truncated packets to arrive in the FastLane exceptions pcap.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51492 Password expiration not working:</strong> This issue has been resolved. Adminstrators must use the global setting <code>configure authority password-policy lifetime N </code> to indicate that all user passwords must be changed every <code>N</code> days.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51663 TCP port reuse causing application steering crashes:</strong> Resolved an issue where backwards state transitions was causing an issue with the TCP client reusing ports.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52018 Overlapping IP Prefix validation may be incorrect, causing a false configuration warning:</strong> Configuration validation for IP Prefixes has been corrected.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52414 RBAC not being honored for <code>show fib</code> output:</strong> Resolved an issue where <code>show fib</code> included entries that the current user did not have permission to view.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52540 Metrics infrastructure resource consumption:</strong> The reporting infrastructure reaching load capacity led to data gaps in custom graphs. Several internal optimizations have been implemented to address this issue. However, to reduce the metrics infrastructure load, metrics in the GUI regarding firmware-generated services, service routes, and tenants will no longer be tracked.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52799 Display Lock Status/Failed Login Attempts in the PCLI and GUI:</strong> Add a &quot;Lock Status&quot; column to the User table as well as the User Details pane, with more details availble on hover. The <code>show user</code> command now includes two new rows, &quot;Lock Status&quot; and &quot;Last Failed Login&quot;. For command details, please see <a href="/docs/cli_reference#show-user-lock-status"><code>show user lock-status</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52889 Highway crash caused by a false negative waypoint exhaustion check:</strong> Waypoint ports reinitialization that is triggered by a false negative exhaustion check can lead to duplicate waypoints and reverse flows on two sessions resulting in a highway crash. This issue has been resolved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53344 Exception on device interface tear down terminates process:</strong> Resolved a rare case where Highway process can terminate and core during config changes if there is an underlying exception to a device-interface on removal.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53393 Empty password attempts not counting towards user lockout:</strong> The SSR counts login attempts with an empty password as failed login attempts. These  contribute to locking a user account if they reach the threshold (the value configured in <code>configure authority password-policy deny</code>,) within a short time window.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53472 Service Routes passing validation on conductor but then failing on local router:</strong> The validation process on the conductor has been updated to identify service-routes with deleted or empty destination lists as invalid.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53538 Custom audit rules not preserved on SSR upgrade:</strong> Resolved an issue where the image-based upgrade (IBU) was not preserving audit rules or <code>dnf.conf</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53787 Stats not present on conductor:</strong> Running <code>show device-interface router all</code> on a conductor caused stats (in-octets, in-unicast-pkts, etc.) to be incorrectly displayed as &quot;n/a&quot; instead of the correct value. This issue has been resolved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53852 <code>host-service snmp-server</code> blocks SVR pings to a <code>network-interface</code> owned address:</strong> Ping traffic was hitting the generated (wildcarded) snmp-server service. The session could not setup due to security policy conflicts. This issue has been resolved; the generated service from an snmp-server host-service now has a UDP transport.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53858 Active sessions counter continuously incrementing:</strong> The SSC active sessions counter has been updated to correctly handle session removal.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53875 The <code>show stats service-area sent success</code> metric was retained longer than needed:</strong> Resolved an issue where the <code>stats default retention short</code> setting was not being honored.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53894 DNS cache-service does not start:</strong> Resolved a race condition that causes the DNS process to fail to start. The log message <code>No TimeoutQueue:</code> can be seen in the logs during this condition.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53916 Pre-existing Teams interfaces conflict with HA interfaces:</strong> In a Mist-managed HA configuration where an HA node has been configured with non-default HA interfaces, performing a release operation on a node in an HA pair leaves the pre-configured HA interfaces in place, and creates a conflict when a new configuration is pushed down from Mist. This would prevent the HA node from operating correctly and forming its HA connections again. This issue has been resolved, and the release operation now removes any pre-existing HA interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53920 Password expiration being applied to remote users:</strong> Resolved an issue that incorrectly enforced password expiration (<code>configure authority password-policy lifetime</code>) to RADIUS users.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53986 <code>nodeMonitor</code> failed to get data for <code>show platform disk</code>:</strong> Some of the dynamic access for <code>smartctl</code> objects were not protected. A check for the object existence has been added before attempting to read it.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54086 Conductor memory exceeded:</strong> In certain cases the salt master on the conductor could grow indefinitely in memory. This may be related to situations with both poor connectivity and the use of the <code>asset-connection-resiliency</code> feature. An update to the salt package has been made to resolve this issue.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54155 nodeMonitor coredump on secondary node after upgrade:</strong> During an upgrade where <code>deviceType</code> was <code>LTE</code> the attempt to get a linux interface name (not supported) failed. This issue has been resolved by implementing a device interface type verification.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54180 Unable to fetch reports from Conductor GUI:</strong> A refactor moved the connectivity check exception, which prevented a service restart. This has been resolved, and the stats now being written to the database and GUI tables.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54189 Application mapping does not correctly match services:</strong> Resolved an issue where the application director was misclassifying sessions due to IP overlap; this is a valid configuration, when services use an IP address with different ports assigned to different services. The SSR now recognizes these different port configurations.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54271 Race condition after a configuration change related to the source nat:</strong> Resolved a rare condition wherethe SharedNatPool was being reset while it was accessed for session setup. This caused a race condition that led to a highway process crash.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54294 Unable to delete capture-filter created with <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator:</strong> Resolved an issue that disallowed deleting capture-filters containing <code>&amp;&amp;</code>. Customers on older versions of software can work around this by creating capture-filters using <code>and</code> instead of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54340 Hub-to-spoke sessions break when failing over from outbound-only Path:</strong> When a session modify occurs due to an ingress change (inter-node -&gt; inter-router) AND an egress change is also detected, the incorrect security was being looked up for the old flow, causing an exception to be thrown and the modify to fail. This would present itself as dropped packets and in logs as a SecurityNotFound error. This issue has been resolved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54490 Permission denied when trying to open a user config file:</strong> Resolved a permissions issue for the <code>connect router</code> command by adding ACLs for reverse SSH so that this is accessible for admin users.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54512 SSR130 moved into an HA cluster does not come up properly:</strong> Resolved an issue where the generation of an improper configuration could lead to a crash loop in the NodeMonitor process.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54803 Control packets are treated with equal priority in overload conditions, causing drops:</strong> Control packets now have preferential treatment under overload conditions, reducing the drop rate.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55002 Password reset loop:</strong> Resolved an issue that caused users created with the <strong>Require password change on first login?</strong> set to <code>yes</code> to get stuck in an infinite loop of password changes when logging in using the GUI.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>WAN-2486 SSR data reporting values that are unrealistically high:</strong> When capturing application usage for application summary learned apps, we sometimes observe really high values for bandwidth and other metrics.
Resolution: The high value was due to an internal corruption when the metrics for these learned applications were removed and added. During such transition there may be memory corruption resulting in the bogus high value. The part of the solution is to ensure the transition happens more gracefully.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>WAN-2547 Invalid memory access producing incorrect bandwidth values:</strong> Implemented a resolution that identifies the invalid memory access, and drops values that are out of scope or otherwise invalid.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51181 Improve <code>save-tech-support-info</code> command:</strong> The PCLI command <code>save tech-support-info</code> now has a default of one day. Additionally, a <code>since</code> argument has been added that limits log collection to only logs generated after the specified value. The <code>since</code> argument can be a relative time delta or an absolute timestamp. The GUI&#x27;s About and Logs pages has the same functionality with a drop down that allows limiting the time window for the displayed/downloaded logs/tech-support-info.</li>

</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52859 Issue moving interface between chassis of hypervisor platforms running SSR (e.g., ENCS):</strong> When swapping physical cable from active node to standby node, the customer experienced low rate packet loss on traffic-engineering enabled device-interfaces.

<li><strong>I95-50787 Rebooting the OS from the conductor throws error code 400:</strong> Resolved an issue in the GUI with the reboot button on the Router page. When trying to reboot a router, the button would fail and display <strong>Error: EOF</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>

<li><strong>I95-51006 Nodes stuck in connected state after upgrade:</strong> On an HA conductor, if the user is performing an upgrade on the first conductor node and that user makes a config commit during the upgrade, then the configuration&#x27;s modified time will become out of sync between the two conductor nodes. When the conductor first node is finished upgrading the result is a loop where the configuration keeps getting committed by each node back and forth until a new commit is made. This issue has been resolved by allowing the peer conductor node to accept the config despite the perceived version disparity. Please note performing a commit mid-upgrade is not supported.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51007 Conductor is incorrectly honoring core pinning:</strong> The cpuProperties cores setting in /etc/128technology/local.init was erroneously isolating cores on conductor nodes when set, even though this setting is intended for a router. This would cause a reduction in available processing cores for normal conductor operations. This setting will now be ignored on the conductor.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51044 Hide <code>forwarding-core-mode</code> on conductor:</strong> Disabled the <code>forwarding-core-mode</code> setting on conductor nodes, since this setting doesn&#x27;t apply to conductor.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51087 SSR fails to download firmware after upgrading the conductor:</strong> Resolved an issue where the first time a conductor is upgraded and <strong>conductor-only</strong> is selected in the software-update settings, the proxy service on the conductor does not work correctly, and downloads fail. The downloads no longer fail.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>WAN-1958 Mist agent crashes:</strong> Increased internal file system limits which were preventing some services from starting correctly at boot. Limits were raised based on expected system usage.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>I95-45348: Update salt master and minion to 3002.8:</strong> When upgrading an HA pair to version 5.6.0, please be aware of the following: While updating the conductors in an HA pair, the upgraded conductor node asset state will remain DISCONNECTED if the active <code>automatedProvisioner</code> is not running a corrected version. When performing an HA conductor upgrade the node running the oldest software assumes leadership. However, the older version will not be able to talk to the new software on the upgraded conductor.</li>
</ul>
<p>The active <code>automatedProvisioner</code> can be determined by running the command <code>show system processes</code>. Once the upgrade begins on the old node, the newly upgraded conductor takes over.</p>
