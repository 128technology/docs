It is highly recommended that upgrades be performed through the conductor UI. Manual upgrades and rollbacks may not be resilient to failures. See <a href="/docs/intro_rollback">Rolling Back Software</a> for more information on these operations.</li></ul><hr><ul><li><strong>I95-42452 Conductor Upgrade Time:</strong> Upgrades to version 5.4 and above can take up to 40 minutes due to the number of rpms being upgraded. Please plan accordingly.</li></ul><hr><ul><li><strong>I95-42624 Upgrade Installer:</strong> Before <strong>upgrading to, or installing</strong> version 5.4 and above, update the Installer to at least version 3.1.0. Failing to upgrade the installer may result in a rollback failure, should a rollback be necessary at any time. The Installer typically prompts you update when a new version is available. Select <strong>Update</strong> when prompted.</li></ul><hr><ul><li><strong>Plugin Upgrades:</strong> If you are running with plugins, updates are required for some plugins <strong>before</strong> upgrading the conductor to SSR version 5.4.0 or higher. Please review the <a href="/docs/intro_upgrade_considerations#plugin-configuration-generation-changes">Plugin Configuration Generation Changes</a> for additional information.  </li></ul><div class="theme-admonition theme-admonition-note alert alert--secondary admonition_LlT9"><div class="admonitionHeading_tbUL"><span class="admonitionIcon_kALy"><svg viewBox="0 0 14 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M6.3 5.69a.942.942 0 0 1-.28-.7c0-.28.09-.52.28-.7.19-.18.42-.28.7-.28.28 0 .52.09.7.28.18.19.28.42.28.7 0 .28-.09.52-.28.7a1 1 0 0 1-.7.3c-.28 0-.52-.11-.7-.3zM8 7.99c-.02-.25-.11-.48-.31-.69-.2-.19-.42-.3-.69-.31H6c-.27.02-.48.13-.69.31-.2.2-.3.44-.31.69h1v3c.02.27.11.5.31.69.2.2.42.31.69.31h1c.27 0 .48-.11.69-.31.2-.19.3-.42.31-.69H8V7.98v.01zM7 2.3c-3.14 0-5.7 2.54-5.7 5.68 0 3.14 2.56 5.7 5.7 5.7s5.7-2.55 5.7-5.7c0-3.15-2.56-5.69-5.7-5.69v.01zM7 .98c3.86 0 7 3.14 7 7s-3.14 7-7 7-7-3.12-7-7 3.14-7 7-7z"></path></svg></span>note</div><div class="admonitionContent_S0QG"><p>The Juniper SSR team does not publicly disclose known or resolved CVEs in our public documentation but instead utilizes our internal bug tracking IDs.
