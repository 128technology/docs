sidebar_label: Updating the IDP Signature Database Manually
---

The IDP signature database is configured by default to download the latest signature updates on a weekly basis. While that timestamp is configurable, in situations where an internal network does not have internet access, updates can be provided by manually downloading the recent updates to the system.

CVE's can exist between clients and Windows or Linux servers even in 

There can be all kinds of CVEs discovered simply between clients and Windows/Linux servers. If we had full customization, we could add things like SSH brute force detection, but those do require SRX commands to enable. As for the SRX commands in this doc — that’s because the IDP is an embedded cSRX. Since we don’t have any way of updating via SSR, CLI commands are required to update the files in the container directly. 

1. Log into the SSR using an account with full shell access (e.g. t128/128tRoutes).
2. Access the device command line interface:
sudo docker exec -it csrx cli 
---
3. Configure the SRX container with the following configuration:
```
configure
set security idp traceoptions file idpd
set security idp traceoptions file size 20m
set security idp traceoptions flag all
set security idp traceoptions level all
commit
exit
```
---
2.	After committing the above configuration, run the following CLI command:

request security idp security-package download full-update 

This command is to get the correct download URL constructed in the idpd log file, which is specific to the software version running on the device. Since the security engine does not expect to have an Internet connection, the command will give a failure status in the CLI, which is expected.

3.	After step 2, get the URL of the security package in the /var/log/idpd file:

The URL below is a sample URL. To get the correct URL for your device, run the following:

show log idpd | match SecPackage

Sample URL from the "/var/log/idpd" log:

Jul 19 05:58:37 [idp_secpack_download_handler]: URL sent to get the SecPackage is:
 
"https://signatures.juniper.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?device=vsrx&adv_dev_info=&feature=idp&os=21.3&build=30&dfa=hs&platform_version=19.4&detector=12.6.130240409&from=&to=latest&type=update&sn=&release=10.3"

4.	Copy the above URL and change the "type" parameter value to "offline" as shown below:
https://signatures.juniper.net/cgi-bin/index.cgi?device=vsrx&adv_dev_info=&feature=idp&os=21.3&build=30&dfa=hs&platform_version=19.4&detector=12.6.130240409&from=&to=latest&type=offline&sn=&release=10.3

IMPORTANT: Please ensure the correct URL is used for your device and version.

5.	Using a browser such as Chrome, download the file manually from the hosted signatures database. Place this file onto an SCP server that is reachable by the SSR device through the management connection. This may require enabling the _internal_ Tenant to reach this SCP server through a management service on TCP port 22. Please refer to the following documentation as needed to enable this access:

https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/session-smart-router/docs/config_management_over_forwarding/#management-services

6.	Enter the shell and download the security packages using the following CLI commands:

start shell
cd tmp
scp <user>@<scp_host>:offline-update.tar.gz .
exit

7.	From the CLI import the security updates from the /tmp directory:

request security idp security-package offline-download package-path /tmp/offline-update.tar.gz

8.	All the required files are copied and unzipped once you installed the offline package. Run the following command to install the policy templates:

request security idp security-package install

9.	Check the install status: 

request security idp security-package install status

Done;policy-templates has been successfully updated into internal repository
(=>/var/db/scripts/commit/templates.xsl)!

10.	Check the policy template version using the following command:

show security idp security-package-version

11.	List the security package attack details using the following command:

show security idp attack detail <attack-name>
