The focus of this document is to provide the required configuration steps to install and operate the SSR in a manner consistent with the requirements of Common Criteria and FIPS. 

Common Criteria for information technology is an international agreement signed by several countries that permits the evaluation of security products against a common set of standards. In the Common Criteria Recognition Arrangement (CCRA) at http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/, the participants agree to mutually recognize evaluations of products performed in other countries. All evaluations are performed using a common methodology for information technology security evaluation.

For more information on Common Criteria, see http://www.commoncriteriaportal.org/.
