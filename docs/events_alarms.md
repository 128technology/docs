| The HA peer node has shut down or stopped running | Verify that the HA peer node is powered on and running. If the node is running verify that the SSR service is running without error by issuing the command `systemctl status 128T`. If the system appears to be running correctly check connectivity between the systems by issuing the PCLI command `show system connectivity` on both nodes. |
| Connectivity between HA nodes is down             | HA node connectivity can be evaluated with the PCLI command `show system connectivity`. If the state to the peer node is not `connected` check the inter node tunnel status by running the PCLI command `show system connectivity internal`. All tunnels to the peer node should report “connected”. If connectivity is down verify links between the systems and if they are up then please contact Juniper support. |

| Alarm triggers above 85% CPU usage for 30 seconds | The alarm clears when the CPU usage drops below 70%. |
| Intermittent process consuming large amount of CPU | If the alarm triggers and clears intermittently this could indicate a periodic load spike or intermittent process workload. Check the current cpu utilization of all processes in the system by using the linux command `top` or the PCLI command `show stats process cpu`. |
| Process consistently consuming large amount of CPU | If the alarm is constantly active this could indicate an under-provisioned system. Check the current cpu utilization of all processes in the system by using the linux command `top` or the PCLI command `show stats process cpu`. Contact Juniper support for guidance on provisioning the system. |

| Network connectivity failure or misconfiguration | Ensure that the SNMP server defined in the configuration is reachable.  Usually this can be determined by issueing a `ping` to the server address.  If the server does not respond, run a packet capture on the interface used for SNMP to observe if traffic is being generated from the SSR upon event generation. |

| Capacity of the cache exceeds 95% of the `max-capacity` configured value | The alarm is cleared once the capacity of the cache goes below 85% of the configured value, and as sessions using those stats expire. The alarm can be addressed by adjusting the `max-capacity` value under `application-identification`. App-id stats are tracked per application, per client, and per next-hop. The granularity of per-application, per-client traffic stats will be reduced while the alarm is active on the system. |
