:::info
Issues resolved in a release are merged into subsequent releases chronologically AND lexicographically. 

For example, issues resolved in `4.3.12`, which was released on 3/12/2021, are resolved in `4.5.6`, which was released on 3/26/2021 and also resolved in `5.1.0`, which was released on 3/15/2021, and so on.

However, issues resolved in `4.3.12`, which was released on 3/12/2021 are not addressed in `4.5.5` because `4.5.5` was released on 2/10/2021. Even though `4.5.5` is lexicographically higher than `4.3.12`, it is chronologically older than 4.3.12.
