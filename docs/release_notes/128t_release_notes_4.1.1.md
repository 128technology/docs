## Issues Fixed
- **I95-21219** In large deployments, displaying all peer paths on the topology page can cause poor performance.  Peer path lines for a given router are only drawn when selecting a router.

- **I95-23631** "All Routers" option on custom dashboards can cause poor performance for large deployments

- **I95-23634** Large configurations can cause the web server performance to degrade

- **I95-25297** auditd and plugin files are unnecessarily rotated

- **I95-25367** The 128T does not respond to ICMP packets destined for its interfaces

- **I95-25897** Installing from an ISO can cause an incorrect core count allocation

- **I95-26021** Window scroll bar become inoperable requiring a complete browser page reload

- **I95-26247** Configuring a prefix-list in a BGP neighbor can cause a system fault

- **I95-26266** When an interface configured for DHCP changes state to operationally down, the system can lock up

- **I95-26284** DHCP packets being relayed through 128T can get dropped

- **I95-26328** Login failure when LDAP username and home directory do not match

- **I95-26385** Added audit events for `global.init` and `local.init`

- **I95-26392** Upgrading an asset through the Conductor was restricted to only use 2.2.x versions of the installer

- **I95-26397** Cannot access dashboard tabs when exceeding screen limit

- **I95-26428** GUI fails to commit cloned router config, producing error: `"reverse SSH port must be unique within an authority"`

- **I95-26457** System can fault on shutdown when unbinding interfaces

- **I95-26467** Setting DHCP option `interface-mtu` causes DHCP server to fail to start

- **I95-26504** Transmitting large ICMP packets over SVR can cause the system to fault

- **I95-26582** SSH keep-alives between conductor and router are happening too frequently

- **I95-26683** Factory defaults can be inadvertently applied when bringing up a HA node

- **I95-26721** kni processes may linger upon shutdown causing security keys to not install properly

- **I95-26765** There exists no way to clear DHCP client leases.  The command `dhcp-agent release-current-dhcp-lease` has been added

- **I95-26788** The system can fault when unprovisioning a redundant interface

- **I95-26799** Errors generated by assets are erroneously duplicated

- **I95-26802** Upgrading or downloading software upgrades on all routers can impair performance of the Conductor. The asset selector has been restricted to a maximum of 10 routers to avoid overwhelming the Conductor with simultaneous download and upgrade operations

- **I95-26828** In large deployments, issuing a PCLI command to all routers from the Conductor can impact performance.  A warning is issued when issuing commands to all routers

- **I95-26838** Events on the GUI dashboard are displayed out of time order

- **I95-26842** PCLI does not honor log-level and always logs at DEBUG

- **I95-26846** `mount` has been added to the output of `save tech-support-info`

- **I95-26848** Commiting a configuration that contains router validation errors from Conductor is not commited

- **I95-26858** 128T may start up with 0 byte length `ntpd.conf` and `global.init` files

- **I95-26862** Asset state timers are unnecessarily aggressive

- **I95-26868** TCP timers for assets are unnecessarily aggressive

- **I95-26870, I95-26889, I95-26908** Large configurations can cause the PCLI to time out

- **I95-26873** Commit and Validatate operations can be executed multiple times for the same configuration.  A message now appears preventing the user from executing the same operation twice

- **I95-26875, I95-26890, I95-26901** Large configuration can cause validation to time out

- **I95-26924** `show assets` command erronously prompts for confirmation

- **I95-26925** Executing `save tech-support-info` can time out

- **I95-26928** 128T can fault on shutdown

- **I95-26929** 128T can fault on startup if it contains BGP configuration
