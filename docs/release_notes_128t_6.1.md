### Upgrade Considerations

:::important
Before upgrading please review the [**Upgrade Considerations**](intro_upgrade_considerations.md) and the [**Rolling Back Software**](intro_rollback.md) pages. Several modifications have been made to the process for verifying configurations, which will impact existing configurations.
:::

- **I95-43243/IN-460 Upgrade and Rollback:** Upgrading or rolling back a system (conductor peer or router) with the interactive installer `install128t`, that is managed by a conductor may result in the system becoming unresponsive. It is recommended that upgrades be performed through the conductor UI. Manual upgrades and rollbacks may not be resilient to failures. See [Rolling Back Software](intro_rollback.md) for more information on these operations.
------
- **I95-42542 Conductor Upgrade Time:** Upgrades can take up to 40 minutes due to the number of rpms being upgraded. Please plan accordingly.
------
- **I95-42624 Upgrade Installer:** Before **upgrading to, or installing** version 5.4 and above, update the Installer to at least version 3.1.0. Failing to upgrade the installer may result in a rollback failure, should a rollback be necessary at any time. The Installer typically prompts you update when a new version is available. Select **Update** when prompted.
------
- **Plugin Upgrades:** If you are running with plugins, updates are required for some plugins **before** upgrading the conductor to SSR version 5.4.0 or higher. Please review the [Plugin Configuration Generation Changes](intro_upgrade_considerations.md#plugin-configuration-generation-changes) for additional information.
------
- **I95-51007 Conductor only - cpuProperties-core value isolating cores:** *In SSR software versions 6.0.0 and greater*, the `cpuProperties-cores` setting in `/etc/128technology/local.init` is erroneously isolating cores on conductor nodes when set. Because the conductor does not forward packets, there should be no traffic cores allocated to or isolated on the conductor for packet forwarding. This setting was previously ignored on the conductor, but while resolving an earlier issue with the installer and initializer that allocated CPU cores for traffic, that is no longer the case. 

It is recommended that prior to upgrading the conductor that the user modify local.init to set this setting to `0`. For example, a setting like this in `/etc/128technology/local.init`:

```
  "cpuProperties" : {
    "cores" : 4
  },
``` 
should be changed to:
```
  "cpuProperties" : {
    "cores" : 0
  },
```

Note that only the relevant section of `local.init` is shown for clarity. All other settings should be left the same.
The change should be made on both nodes of an HA system. If a conductor is already running 6.0.0 or later it will be necessary to `systemctl restart 128T` on each node after making this change. If the modification is made prior to upgrade it is not necessary to restart 128T service as this will be performed during the upgrade. Making this change on versions earlier than 6.0.0 will not affect operation, and will not require a restart. 

This issue will be corrected in an upcoming release.

## Release 6.1.6-7

**Release Date:** December 29, 2023

### Resolved Issues Requiring Configuration Changes

- **I95-46120 HA Fabric Warning message supression in Azure:** In Azure, it is not possible to configure a non-forwarding fabric interface on the SSR, thus this error will be present on every commit. This message is now supressed.
------
- **I95-47041 Selection of Mist Cloud instance during whitebox onboarding:** The onboarding interface now silently queries all Mist Instances and provides a drop down selector to allow login to the appropriate Mist instance (Global01, Global03, EU, etc.).
------
- **I95-51181 Improve `save-tech-support-info` command:** The PCLI command `save tech-support-info` now has a default collection period of one day. Additionally, a `since` argument has been added that limits log collection to only logs generated after the specified value. The `since` argument can be a relative time delta or an absolute timestamp. The GUI's About and Logs pages has the same functionality with a drop down that allows limiting the time window for the displayed/downloaded logs/tech-support-info.
------
- **I95-52406 Download MIBs from the GUI:** A button has been added to the GUI, in the Documentation pane of the About Page, to download the SNMP MIB definitions for SSR.
------
- **I95-52703 Tenancy consideration in Application ID lookup:** Application Identification service lookups now consider the source tenant. This allows matches to be specific to certain networks/users. See [AppID and Tenancy](concepts_appid.md#appid-and-tenancy) for more information.
------
- **I95-52799 Display Lock Status/Failed Login Attempts in the PCLI and GUI:** Add a "Lock Status" column to the User table as well as the User Details pane, with more details availble on hover. The `show user` command now includes two new rows, "Lock Status" and "Last Failed Login". For command details, please see [`show user lock-status`](cli_reference.md#show-user-lock-status).

### Resolved Issues

- **The following CVE's have been identified and addressed in this release:** CVE-2022-42896, CVE-2023-1281, CVE-2023-1829, CVE-2023-2124, CVE-2023-2194, CVE-2023-2235, CVE-2022-41974, CVE-2023-32360, CVE-2023-22045, CVE-2023-22049, CVE-2020-12321, CVE-2022-41742, CVE-2022-41741, CVE-2023-2650, CVE-2023-3446, CVE-2023-3817, CVE-2023-3341, CVE-2023-22081, CVE-2022-0934, CVE-2023-46847.
------
- **I95-38188 Re-Homing an SSR in certain circumstances leaves residual services:** If an SSR is rehomed from an HA conductor to a standalone conductor, the services pointing to the second node of the HA conductor were not removed. Resolved the issue where the reverse SSH tunnels from a managed router to the second HA conductor node were not cleaned up if the conductor was converted back to a standalone conductor.
------
- **I95-42466 Changing the PCI address of an HA interface breaks HA:** Resolved an issue where moving a non-forwarding fabric HA sync device-interface from one PCI address to another PCI address would not properly clean up the team interface from the old PCI address.
------
- **I95-48783 Conductor process logs are unbounded, risking storage exhaustion:** `auditd` logs consuming the disk space when the node monitor is in a disconnected state and the audit logs are left unconsumed. There was a limit to the log file size, but not the number of files. The number of files is now limited.
------
- **I95-50493 Memory calculation for alarms is confusing:** This alarm was designed to trigger when memory usage went above 90% and clear only when memory usage went below 80%, causing confusion. The memory usage alarm no longer requires memory usage to go below 80% to clear; it will clear when memory usage goes below 90%.
------
- **I95-50537 Detect and log invalid TCP establishment flags:** TCP packets with illegal flag combinations are dropped before they can set up a session, rather than after. 
------
- **I95-50540 Denied traffic events not displaying in the GUI or PCLI:** Resolved an issue that prevented displaying denied traffic events in the `show events` PCLI command and in the GUI. Users would see `% Error: Unhandled TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices` in the PCLI, and `An unknown traffic event occurred` in the GUI. 
------
- **I95-51191 BFD metrics not cleaned up properly:** The BFDAgent holds onto the stats for peer paths; If the config is changed on a router, new stats are made but the old ones were not being deleted. The old BFD by-peer-path stats are now deleted when a VLAN configuration change is made.
------
- **I95-51459 Logs and exception pcaps are periodically filled with error logs and truncated packets:** Resolved an issue where ICMP error respond packets for encapsulated traffic caused `PacketBufferDataNotFound: Could not find specified data in packet` error logs to be generated, or truncated packets to arrive in the FastLane exceptions pcap. 
------
- **I95-51864 Ethernet Over SVR (EoSVR) not working for multi-hop SVR scenarios:** When EoSVR traffic traverses over a dogleg path in a HA node topology, traffic failed to traverse the middle node. EoSVR packets are no longer incorrectly dropped when routed over an inter-node path when coming from an SVR path.
------
- **II95-52018 Overlapping IP Prefix validation may be incorrect, causing a false configuration warning:** Configuration validation for IP Prefixes has been corrected.
------
- **I95-52414 RBAC not being honored for `show fib` output:** Resolved an issue where `show fib` included entries that the current user did not have permission to view.
------
- **I95-52498 AppID allows session when it should be blocked:** When utilizing the Application Identification functionality, a TCP reset is now sent to clients to correct this behavior.
------- 
- **I95-52615 Set TTL multi-hop range correctly:** The TTL multi-hop field allowed a value of 0, but had no impact. The range has been corrected to 1-255, and no longer accepts a value of 0.
------
- **I95-52855 DHCP Relay stopped functioning after removing disabled DHCP Servers:** When a number of disabled DHCP servers were deleted from the configuration, the server interface mappings were deleted as well. Updates have been made to re-enable DHCP relay when a DHCP server or interface is removed.
------
- **I95-52859 Issue moving interface between chassis of hypervisor platforms running SSR (e.g., ENCS):** When swapping physical cable from active node to standby node, the customer experienced low rate packet loss on traffic-engineering enabled device-interfaces. To resolve this issue, the traffic-engineering transmit-cap is no longer ignored on device-interfaces which have unresolved link-speed.
------
- **I95-52889 Highway crash caused by a false negative waypoint exhaustion check:** Waypoint ports reinitialization that is triggered by a false negative exhaustion check can lead to duplicate waypoints and reverse flows on two sessions resulting in a highway crash. This issue has been resolved.
------
- **I95-52994 Routers continue to request the conductor configuration:** Resolved an issue where a managed router continued to request the configuration from the conductor even after a validation or datamodel incompatibility issue.
------
- **I95-52999 Package-based Interactive Install does not recognize Mellanox CX6 LX (10/25G) interfaces:** Resolved a rare case where NICs with kernel drivers that exist in EL8 but not in EL7 will not be enumerated during Interactive ISO installation. 
------
- **I95-53000 Process highway disconnected messages caused by NIC driver bug:** The DPDK driver code for the Broadcom NICs contained a bug that caused the querying of the extended statistic to fail. The Broadcom NIC driver has been upgraded to resolve the issue.
------
- **I95-53002 NTP setup check fails on startup:** Resolved an issue in the NTP startup sequence, due to an incorrect path for the NTP configuration.
------ 
- **I95-53009 RPM signature verification missing for all artifacts:** Verification for all ISO RPMs has been added.
------
- **I95-53015 Highway log fills with `INFO (divertedPackeTP) icmp response packet failed` messages when the BFD peer is down:** This message is informational and is now logged appropriately.
------
- **I95-53105 Conductor to router API RBAC rules not being followed:** Resolved an issue where the user is getting elevated to admin on the managed router, thus returning more data than necessary.
------
- **I95-53114 Broadcom interfaces stuck in `admin down` after upgrade:** Resolved an issue where device-interfaces on Broadcom NICs wouldn't come up properly if initially configured with `enabled false`.
------
- **I95-53130 Errors seen on Q-in-Q enabled interface after upgrade:** Interfaces were unable to receive jumbo packets unless MTU is configured to be large enough. This resolution allows the reception of jumbo packets regardless of the MTU setting.
------
- **I95-53185 Rare race condition causing highway crash:** Resolved a rare race condition between flow install and flow lookup causing a highway crash.
------
- **I95-53253 Include dmesg and systemd journal unit in TSI:** Include output from dmesg and systemd journal unit in TSI in order to assist in debugging future platform related issues.
------
- **I95-53259 Initialization time out may result in SSR failing to start:** Resolved an issue where SSR may fail to start. An example of this would be unreachable audit server was configured that would delay the startup initialization causing SSR to exceed the timeout and fail to start.
------
- **I95-53262 VRRP status shows active for both nodes when dual node ha redundancy is configured on bond interface:** Bonded X710 devices were unable to receive VRRP from each other, resulting in active-active scenario. This resolution disables source pruning by default on these devices.
------
- **I95-53288 Fetching detailed bond info from the conductor for routers fails:** The conductor was incorrectly posting a `JSONDecodeError` when trying to parse bond information that was missing from the router response. This issue has been resolved.
------
- **I95-53321 Syslog datamodel is limited:** Added the following configurable syslog facility values `auth`, `authpriv`, `cron`, `daemon`, `kern`, `lpr`, `mail`, `news`, `syslog`, `user`, and `uucp`.
-----
- **I95-53344 Exception on device interface tear down terminates process:** Resolved a rare case where Highway process can terminate and core during config changes if there is an underlying exception to a device-interface on removal.
------
- **I95-53358 Disable/enable of LACP takes the Bond interface down:** Dynamic reconfiguration has been enhanced to support LACP enable/disable while traffic flows by removing the dedicated queue flow (for LACP) when removing a member from bond. 
------
- **I95-53393 Empty password attempts not counting towards user lockout:** The SSR counts login attempts with an empty password as failed login attempts. These  contribute to locking a user account if they reach the threshold (the value configured in `configure authority password-policy deny`,) within a short time window. 
------
- **I95-53472 Service Routes passing validation on conductor but then failing on local router:** The validation process on the conductor has been updated to identify service-routes with deleted or empty destination lists as invalid.  
------
- **I95-53538 Custom audit rules not preserved on SSR upgrade:** Resolved an issue where the image-based upgrade (IBU) was not preserving audit rules or `dnf.conf`.
------
- **I95-53641 BGP routes between peers do not immediately transition to the Connected state:** A change has been made to reduce the time that BGP routes learned from a BGP over SVR neighbor are withdrawn when the peer paths are lost to the neighbor.
------
- **I95-53787 Stats not present on conductor:** Running `show device-interface router all` on a conductor caused stats (in-octets, in-unicast-pkts, etc...) to be incorrectly displayed as "n/a" instead of the correct value. This issue has been resolved.
------
- **I95-53852 `host-service snmp-server` blocks SVR pings to a `network-interface` owned address:** Ping traffic was hitting the generated (wildcarded) snmp-server service. The session could not setup due to security policy conflicts. This issue has been resolved; the generated service from an snmp-server host-service now has a UDP transport.
------
- **I95-53858 Active sessions counter continuously incrementing:** The SSC active sessions counter has been updated to correctly handle session removal. 
------
- **I95-53875 The `show stats service-area sent success` metric was retained longer than needed:** Resolved an issue where the `stats default retention short` setting was not being honored.
------
- **I95-53894 DNS cache-service does not start:** Resolved a race condition that causes the DNS process to fail to start. The log message `No TimeoutQueue:` can be seen in the logs during this condition.
------
- **I95-53907 SSR readvertising SA to MSDP mesh peers:** Resolved an issue where MSDP SA's received from a mesh-group peer were being re-advertised to the mesh-group. This issue has been resolved by verifying sender of the SA.
------
- **I95-53915 Removing an X710/X722 port from SSR can cause high RX latency:** Deleting an SSR interface from an X710/722 NIC which is part of a multi-port device introduces RX latency into sibling ports until the SSR is restarted. This has been resolved by enabling the i40e “multi-driver” mode to preserve global registers that are shared across ports.
------
- **I95-53916 Pre-existing Teams interfaces conflict with HA interfaces:** In a Mist-managed HA configuration where an HA node has been configured with non-default HA interfaces, performing a release operation on a node in an HA pair leaves the pre-configured HA interfaces in place, and creates a conflict when a new configuration is pushed down from Mist. This would prevent the HA node from operating correctly and forming its HA connections again. This issue has been resolved, and the release operation now removes any pre-existing HA interfaces.
------
- **I95-53986 `nodeMonitor` failed to get data for `show platform disk`:** Some of the dynamic access for `smartctl` objects were not protected. A check for the object existence has been added before attempting to read it.
------
- **I95-54030 Node sending ARP requests to the wrong MAC:** After an SFP hot swap, node1 was sending ARP requests to the wrong MAC. An issue where E810 interfaces with default MTU configuration could potentially transmit corrupt ARP response packets has been resolved. 
------
- **I95-54051 Broadcom driver causing memory corruption, leading to a system fault:** Updated the driver support for BNXT NICs. 
------
- **I95-54086 Conductor memory exceeded:** In certain cases the salt master on the conductor could grow indefinitely in memory. This may be related to situations with both poor connectivity and the use of the `asset-connection-resiliency` feature. An update to the salt package has been made to resolve this issue.
------
- **I95-54091 Software Lifecycle History page does not load:** A time selector has been added to allow the user to provide parameters around the amount of data that is loaded. 
------
- **I95-54126 VRRP HA - EoSVR to VRRP HA - EoSVR not recovering after failure:** When EoSVR is enabled, VRRP packets (which are multicast frames) are not detected as destined for the SSR and are being classified as non-IP frames that should be encapsulated for EoSVR. To resolve this issue, detection/classification enhancements have been made to recognize VRRP packets that match the configured VRID and not forward them in the EoSVR tunnel.
------
- **I95-54133 IDP severity grouping mislabeled:** Resolved an issue where minor severity levels were labeled incorrectly.
------
- **I95-54155 nodeMonitor coredump on secondary node after upgrade:** During an upgrade where `deviceType` was `LTE` the attempt to get a linux interface name (not supported) failed. This issue has been resolved by implemting a device interface type verification.
------
- **I95-54180 Unable to fetch reports from Conductor GUI:** A refactor moved the connectivity check exception, which prevented a service restart. This has been resolved, and the stats now being written to the database and GUI tables.
------
- **I95-54199 Image based installation hangs in Azure:** Resolved a dependency issue causing a race condition between Azure and the SSR setup; azure agent requires networking, but `t128-firstboot-setup.sh` must run before network startup to configure the NIC names. The dependencies have been correctly sequenced.
------
- **I95-54265 Schema not included in API response for a template:** The `schema` object has been added to the API. 
------
- **I95-54294 Unable to delete capture-filter created with `&&` operator:** Resolved an issue that disallowed deleting capture-filters containing `&&`. Customers on older versions of software can work around this by creating capture-filters using `and` instead of `&&`.
------
- **I95-54398 ASM - Prune flag set incorrectly:** Resolved an issue with how outgoing interfaces in the mroute entry are reported. If the outgoing interface list only contains PIM SVR interfaces, the P flag was displayed incorrectly. The outgoing interface list is populated correctly, and the P flag now shows correctly.
------
- **I95-54434 Mist PCAP failure - inverted commands observed by the device:** In rare cases where captures are created and deleted too quickly, a delete command may be received by the device before the create command. These timing issues have been resolved.
------
- **I95-54490 Permission denied when trying to open a user config file:** Resolved a permissions issue for the `connect router` command by adding ACLs for reverse SSH nodeIdentifier so that this is accessible for admin users.
------

## Release 6.1.5-14

**Release Date:** September 22, 2023

### Resolved Issues Requiring Configuration Changes

- **I95-48174 Expand supported values for DHCP option:** DHCP option 43 is now a supported option, as well as a binary encoded-type (hex/byte) support. Valid examples are `0xabcdef` and `0x123456`.
------
- **I95-52163 Handle incoming public keys from peer conductor node:** Added functionality to allow conductor nodes to share the authorized keys of managed routers between each other. If the SSH public key is retrieved from a managed router by one conductor node, then it is automatically shared with its conductor peer node.
------
- **I95-52316 Enhancements to Overlapping FIB Services:** The [`fib-service-match`](config_command_guide.md#configure-authority-fib-service-match) command has been added to provide additional control over the creation of FIB entries in combination with routing updates. 
  - `best-match-only` This is the default value, and legacy behavior. When comparing prefixes from a route update to addresses configured in services, only addresses with the longest prefix match for a particular route are considered. In cases of transport overlap, services are visited in alphabetical order.
  - `any-match` introduces new behavior. All service addresses that match the route update are considered when creating the FIB entries, including those with prefixes shorter than the update or those that do not have the best match service address. The transports from the service with the longest prefix are considered first. This minimizes missed entries, but may result in a higher FIB usage. 
------
- **I95-52517 Allow users the ability to configure the OSPF SPF timers:** Support for user-configured values for SPF delay has been added. Users can now specify values for spf delay, hold-time, and maximum-hold-time. For additional information, see [OSPF SPF Timers](config_command_guide.md#configure-authority-router-routing-ospf-timers-spf).

### Resolved Issues

------
- **I95-41386/I95-52114 HA pair device interface's redundancy status stays non-redundant even though the interface operational status is up:** Resolved a race condition when selecting the active components between HA nodes.
------
- **I95-50671 Office365 traffic is not recognized:** Resolved an issue where Office365 traffic was being miscategorized and therefore not fully qualified. O365 traffic, when traversing over SVR, is no longer miscategorized.
------
- **I95-50708 Time series data for memory of the salt_master process periodically significantly decreases:** Incorrect method for polling application memory data; this resulted in dips in application memory being presented. This issue has been resolved.
------
- **I95-51336 App-ID stats entry not getting cleaned up after expiration:** In some cases, a session may not have installed correctly, preventing the expired App-ID stats from being removed. The App-ID stats entries are now cleaned up appropriately.
------
- **I95-51450 Support for 100/Full Speed/Duplex on Intel I225-V Driver NICs:** The DPDK driver has been updated to allow fixed speed and duplex configuration to work with IGC i225 NICs.
------
- **I95-51492 Password expiration not working:** This issue has been resolved. Adminstrators must use the global setting `configure authority password-policy lifetime N ` to indicate that all user passwords must be changed every `N` days.
------
- **I95-51638 Traceroute does not complete over SSR, but does using linux:** The traceroute command was unable to resolve through some network elements. The default SSR traceroute UDP port number has been changed to a more common/recognized port.
------
- **I95-51766 TX lockup detector not enabled for LAG/bonded interfaces:** The datapath lockup detection mechanism has been re-enabled to run on bond interfaces. 
------
- **I95-51800 Radius authentication failure - Incorrect NAS IP address:** The ability to specify the NAS-IP-Address and NAS-Identifier has been added to the data model for configuring these Radius options per node. This can be used in cases where the Radius server is configured to use an identifier, or in cases where it is necessary to match the source IP address of the Radius requests behind SSR or NAT.
------
- **I95-51801 The SSR is unable to see DHCP ACK for the DHCP Request sent by an EX4100:** Added an `authoritative` field for DHCP servers to enable/disable `authoritative` mode, which allows the server to send a NAK in response to unknown clients. This field is set to `true` by default.
------
- **I95-51992 Multi-queue support for Bond interfaces:** Support for a bond `device-interface` to use multiple RX/TX queues has been added. 
------
- **I95-52104 URI escape characters handled incorrectly:** The `lookup application by-domain` and `clear app-id cache-entry url` were handling url parameters incorrectly, in lookup, creating and clearing cache entries. This has been resolved and each command now performs the correct operation.
------
- **I95 52105 Permissions error when attempting to `delete certificate webserver`:** Resolved an issue where `delete certificate webserver` and `create cerificate webserver` with an existing certificate were failing. On older versions of software this can be worked around by running `sudo rm -rf /etc/128technology/pki/webserver.pem`.
------
- **I95-52113 Application Identification on the SSR runs at 100% CPU utilization:** Resolved an overrun bug that was causing the SSR to enter a loop when loading port ranges. This issue has been resolved.
------
- **I95-52147 Adding and deleting bond interfaces with the same name would leave the interface in a down state:** This issue has been resolved.
------
- **I95-52158 Spoke is rejecting hub BFD packets, and peering is unable to come up over LTE:** In a corner case where the spoke private LTE IP changes before BFD is up and the public/hub-received IP stays the same, the hub gets stuck in the init state. 
This issue has been resolved; the LTE IP change is now handled it as a source-nat change, where the flows and actions can be recreated with the updated LTE private IP.
------
- **I95-52208 Metrics queries return incomplete data when FIPS is enabled:** Resolved an issue where a FIPS-incompatible hashing function was causing missing or incomplete metrics data. 
------
- **I95-52279 Bond configured with VRRP not receiving UDP traffic when LACP is enabled:** Resolved an issue on the SSR120/SSR130 where VRRP Virtual MACs are being silently dropped by Bond PMD in LACP mode. Packets with VRRP virtual destination MACs are now correctly processed by the Bond PMD when using LACP on the SSR120/SSR130. This issue will be resolved on the SSR1200/1300/1400/1500 in an upcoming release.

- **I95-52283 Correct the Domain Matching order:** When using web filtering, the SSR now properly enforces the [Service Matching Order.](config_domain-based_web_filter.md/#service-matching-order)
------
- **I95-52305 High CPU and memory utilization when Application Identification is enabled:** Resolved memory and CPU issues resulting from attempting to compact very large application identification documents.
------
- **I95-52402 Router stuck in `Upgrading` state:** Resolved an issue with `conductor-only` mode, where the conductor was attempting to download the installer before the software access proxies were in place, preventing an update to the installer.
------
- **I95-52480 Conductor shows alarms when applications are added to the router configuration:** A condition has been added that verifies whether the node is a router or conductor before running application update and generating alarms on a conductor.
------
- **I95-52491 Crash in highway process due to segmented metadata:** Resolved an issue processing metadata that is segmented across two packet buffers. The segmented packets are no longer discarded and the dataplane no longer crashes when processing a packet comprised of segmented metadata.
------
- **I95-52547 Unable to set DHCP option 160:** Resolved an issue where DHCP option 160 was being treated as a standard option and was unavailable to be defined as an option. When it was set, it would prevent the DHCP server from starting. This has been corrected. 
------
- **I95-52599 Conductors display different assets on different HA nodes:** If the state table of an inactive HA node becomes out of sync with the active HA node, then some assets were being skipped when parsing the asset state response. This issue has been resolved through the reporting of asset IDs from the active node state table. 
------
- **I95-50562 / I95-52626 Forwarding plane control message bursts create exception, causing a packet buffer leak:** Resolved a condition where backpressure caused the messaging mechanism to develop buffer leaks. Proper handling of exceptions now prevents buffer leaks. The control buffer capacity has been increased to better handle bursts as part of the resolution.
------
- **I95-52650 Asset state transition on conductor is slow for deployments with greater than 250 routers:** An optimization was made to an internal calculation and improve the speed at which synchronization requests are processed.
------
- **I95-52816 Config Validation may generate errors in the wrong field:** Resolved an issue during the validation of BGP graceful-restart configuration settings that could lead to generating incorrect errors/warnings during configuration validation.
------
- **I95-52822 ARP fails to resolve:** An earlier change caused ports on an X553 that use SFPs to no longer correctly report link status. This issue has been resolved and the link status is now reported accurately. 
------
- **I95-52968 Configuration template not being applied by the conductor to a router during upgrade:** Resolved an issue where a managed router would silently fail to apply a configuration from a conductor with a greater software version if the configuration contained features that the router's earlier SSR version did not understand. Specifically, if a config field such as an enumeration, that the router was aware of, had new values added to it in the conductor's version of software then the configuration would not be applied.
------
- **I95-52971 Inconsistent hash and signing of RPM files:** Some small number of RPM files did not usen the `sha256` hash for sigining. This has been corrected and all RPM packages on the distribution ISO are digest sha256 for Common Criteria.
------
- **I95-53017 Some files incorrectly marked as executable:** Some cache files were incorrectly marked as executable, and were flagged as part of the Common Criteria validation. These files have been correctly identified and marked. 
------
- **I95-53285 User datastore issue when renaming a router:** Resolved an issue where HTTP requests would stop working to a router after the router's name was changed, but before the SSR was restarted.
------
- **WAN-2090 Conductor managed SSR applications in WAN Insights showing up as numbers:** Resolved an issue with stats APIs, which were not properly handling some internal service names.

### Caveats

- **I95-52426 Incorrect behavior when configuring an IDP custom rule definition:** In a case where a user is modifying a rule to **decrease** the action type to an `alert`, alerts for that vulnerability will not work. The attack will be allowed to pass through undetected. For example, if the action `close-tcp-connection` is downgraded to `alert`, the attacks will pass through undetected.
This issue is actively being addressed, and will be resolved in an upcoming patch release. If you need to use this specific functionality, we recommend creating a custom exception rule specifying the source and destination IP address, along with the vulnerability name, rather than downgrading a vulnerability to an `alert`. 
------
- **I95-53124 Sessions destined to private IP address (RFC1918) are incorrectly reported using the application name as the service name:** We have identified an issue where sessions destined to private IP address (RFC1918), are incorrectly reported with the application name as the service name, even if the traffic is HTTP/HTTPS. Session traffic continues to follow the appropriate service / routing profile, but the stats reported may not accurately reflect the learned applications. This is actively being addressed and will be resolved in a future patch.
------
- **I95-53878 Dynamic Reconfiguration with LAG/LACP:** Any changes to the LAG configuration require a restart of the 128T service. Configuration changes to the LAG should be performed during a maintenance window, as the changes may disrupt traffic flow. 

### Known Issues

- **I95-52977 Mellanox NIC Port Appropriation:** Port 4791 is an IANA reserved port for ROCEv2 and should not be used for user traffic. 

## Release 6.1.4-23.r2

**Release Date:** July 14, 2023

### New Features

- **I95-466 LAG/LACP Support:** Link Aggregation Groups are formed by connecting multiple ports in parallel between two devices. LACP is the protocol that defines how the group of interfaces operates. Users define the LAG interface and then configure the member device interfaces. This feature is currently in Beta; for more information, a list of supported devices and caveats, see [Link Aggregation and LACP](config_lacp.md).
------
- **I95-10141 LLDP Support:** The LLDP mode and parameters allow users to configure the device interface to disable LLDP advertisements, set a `receive-only` mode, or enable sending and receiving LLDP packets. For information about configuring LLDP, see [`lldp`](config_reference_guide.md#lldp).
------
- **I95-20864 Support for Multicast:** Multicast is a “one source, many destinations” method of traffic distribution. For more information, see [Multicast](config_multicast.md). The previous implementation of multicast has been replaced by this new version and is no longer supported. The issue relating to encryption (I95-48792) is addressed in the new implementation. 
------
- **I95-44473 Application Steering:** Application Steering provides the ability to configure unique steering policies for individual applications based on the application name, category, application signatures, URLs, and domains. Once the traffic has been classified, it can be steered across the available paths. For more information, see [Application Steering](config_application_steering.md).
------
- **I95-49928 BGP over SVR Inter-Hub Steering:** Path based BGP over SVR Routing responds to changes in peer adjacency, operational status, or SLA. It adds the ability to select and advertise BGP routes between BGP over SVR neighbors. It does this by monitoring the peer paths between BGP over SVR peers and dynamically adjusting the BGP neighbor inbound and outbound policy on those peers to reflect the priority and SLA of the peer paths. For more information, see [BGP over SVR Inter-Hub Steering](config_bgp.md#bgp-over-svr-inter-hub-steering).
------
- **I95-50571/I95-50949/I95-51039 Add packet buffer tracking to help analyze buffer exhaustion:** Packet buffer location tracking has been added, and the following PCLI commands have been created for buffer tracking. 
  - `show packet-buffer locations`
  - `save packet-buffer snapshot`
------
- **I95-48014 IDP Custom Rules and Policies:** Users can customize an existing base IDP policy by creating exception-based rules. Using an existing IDP policy, you can modify the profile to allow the specific traffic to flow as expected within the network. See [IDP Custom Rules](concepts_ssr_idp.md#idp-custom-rules) for overview information, and refer to [Modifying IDP Policies](config_idp.md#modifying-idp-policies) for configuration information.
------
- **I95-50973 DSCP Steering with BGP over SVR:** [DSCP steering](config_dscp_steering.md) is now supported on BGP over SVR.
------
- **I95-51105 Options added to the import operation to enable or disable checking the signatures of RPMs:** The `import iso` command now verifies the signatures of all imported RPMs. This is controlled from the PCLI by passing in the `check-rpm-signature {required(default) | allow-unsigned | disabled}` option to require that all RPMs are signed and verified, allow importing ISOs with unsigned RPMs and verify those that are signed, or to disable the signature checking altogether. 
------
- **I95-51296 Show `Time in Status` in the `show assets` detail view:** The asset `Time in Status` field has been added to the Detail view. 
------
- **I95-51946 Add LAG related TLVs to LLDP:** Support for LLDP on LAG interfaces has been added.

### Resolved Issues

- **The following issues have been resolved as part of our ongoing security certification-related initiative:** I95-48924, I95-48927, I95-48928, I95-48943, I95-49912, I95-49913, I95-49914, I95-50535, I95-51397, IN-533
------
- **I95-35069 Disallow changing the role of a node:** Once set, changing the role of a node cannot be changed. The configuration validation process has been updated to not allow this change. 
------
- **I95-46895 Teams traffic classified as Azure:** Improvements made to the application database `ip-protocol-port lookup` during session classification. 
------
- **I95-47960 Incorrect progress message for `show dns resolutions`:** The progress message for this command now correctly displays `Retrieving dns resolutions...`.
------
- **I95-49587 ICMP session classification improvement:** The application lookup for ICMP sessions now accurately identifies the correct service.
------
- **I95-49598 Automatically choose the number of session-processor threads:** If session-setup-scaling is provisioned to true, the SSR will now automatically determine the number of threads to use for session processing.
------
- **I95-49791 Audit rules to track modification of config files:** Added rules to track the modification of grub configuration files, to aid in troubleshooting. 
------
- **I95-50338 "About this System" link on GUI not working:** The link target is no longer valid, and the link has been removed from the GUI. 
------
- **I95-50632 Add Buffer tracking monitoring to lockup detector:** LockupDetector is now able to identify and take corrective action should a network packet pool buffer exhaustion event occur. 
------
- **I95-51003 `show stats process queue depth` command is redundant:** The redundant `process/queue/depth` statistic has been removed. It is superseded by `process/thread/queue/depth` and the information available using `show stats process thread queue depth` and related commands.
------
- **I95-51053 ESP session stuck in Incomplete state:** Resolved an issue where SVR sessions from network-interfaces with `dscp-steering enabled` can be stuck in an incomplete state.
------
- **I95-51081 `bgp-service-generation service-policy` is being filtered on the conductor:** The `bgp-service-generation service-policy` is now marked as authority wide so it is not filtered. This prevents managed routers from rejecting configurations containing `bgp-service-generation` and getting out of sync with the conductor.
------
- **I95-51167 Unable to override auto-generated peer service-route:** The user can now provision a `service-route` with the same `name` as an automatically-generated one. The user's `service-route` takes precedence and will be used instead of the generated one.
------
- **I95-51177 Ethernet over SVR setting wrong egress MAC address:** Ethernet over SVR now correctly sets the egress MAC address when using `outbound-only` mode.
------
- **I95-51178 Increase default `juteMaxBufferSize`:** The default `juteMaxBufferSize` has been increased to 10MB, which addresses issues where the device is unable to commit very large configurations.
------
- **I95-51201 Autocompletion in `adopt` command generates invalid organization name:** When using tab-completion to enter the site name from the `adopt` command in the PCLI, it will add quotations around the site name if there are whitespaces in the name. The PCLI now properly handles quotes and whitespace in organization names when running the PCLI adopt command.
------
- **I95-51203 Update stats retention periods:** Some of the `process/thread/queue`  statistics are now recorded for a longer time period, and are available in custom charts and tables on the Conductor.
------
- **I95-51235 Remove service-address overlap warning:** Configuration validation warnings for overlapping IP addresses within the same service are no longer generated, because they are valid in certain scenarios. A new warning has been added when a service address of only "0.0.0.0" (without the trailing prefix /0) is provisioned.
------
- **I95-51284 Routers remain in the connected state:** Updated the dependencies within the salt minion to resolve an issue where an asset is stuck in the connected state, displaying the error: `Error getting asset's public key: 'ssh.set_auth_key', retrying...`.
------
- **I95-51296 Show Time in Status in the show assets detail view:** The asset Time in Status field has been added to the Detail view.
------
- **I95-51359 Unable to set the OSPF MTU:** Added the ability for users to set the MTU to a non-default value.
------
- **I95-51403 GUI displays "Download in Progress" even after the download is complete:** Resolved an issue where a download success event is not created after the version shows up as downloaded in the Software Versions. 
------
- **I95-51427 GUI not displaying all the version information:** The GUI About page now displays additional version information previously only displayed in the PCLI `show system version detail`.
------
- **I95-51629 `ingress-source-nat-pool` should not display non-SVR traffic:** Previously, the `ingress-source-nat-pool` configured under `network-interface` applied to both SVR and non-SVR sessions. Now it only applies to SVR sessions.
------
- **I95-51635 `traceroute` command unable to resolve an endpoint:** Resolved a scenario where an aborted `traceroute` command that was not able to resolve could result in a highway process crash.
------
- **I95-51650 `log-category PCLI` command not working:** Resolved an issue that disallowed setting `config authority router <name> system log-category PCLI`. We now also allow configuring the following log categories:
  - CFGD
  - SNMP
  - HTTP
------
- **I95-51658 Allow `sync` command in resynchronizing state:** Resolved an issue where the user received an error when executing the `send command sync` command while an asset was in the `resynchronizing` state.
------
- **I95-51714 Adding and deleting a `domain-name` in the same operation causes an error:** Resolved an issue in the configuration validation that generated an error when duplicate domain-names are removed from and added to the service configuration.
------
- **I95-51734 Remove duplicate transport port-ranges from modules before adding to service:** Resolved an issue where FIB entries are not installed when app-id modules have conflicting or overlapping port-ranges, and are being placed into one service.
------
- **I95-51788 Path index is not displayed correctly for `show sessions by-id`:** `show sessions by-id` has been updated to display MTU and PathIndex.
------
- **I95-51792 Low MTU threshold causing metadata fragmentation:** Fixed the incorrect handling of packets where metadata is fragmented due to unreasonably low MTU, causing the packet buffers to become exhausted.
-----
- **I95-51793 Path MTU discovery dropping very low:** Fixed PMTU discovery from ever resolving to an unreasonably low MTU, which could previously occur during a link flap event.
------
- **I95-51794 Core dump on systems with greater than 10 physical interfaces, such as Lenovo SR-650:** Resolved an issue where the SR-650 was crashing due to uninitialized flags field. Support has been added for these devices. 
------
- **I95-51865 NTP not syncing for HA nodes:** Added the ability to configure the orphan stratum for the HA peer node. This was previously hard-coded to 5 but this change allows an HA peer to sync when the upstream server is of a lower stratum, if so desired by the user.
------
- **I95-51915 Report buffer allocaction failures:** `alloc-failure` stats are now gathered per device and included in the device stats, allowing the watchdog to detect a failure and respond.
------
- **I95-51951 Packets not being properly encapsulated in BFD:** Path metrics drop packets are now properly encapsulated when SVR over BFD feature is enabled.
------
- **I95-51964 Make the loopback-address available on the conductor:** The loopback-address configuration  is now accessible on the conductor, and allows for a per node user defined address to be configured for overlay management traffic.
------
- **I95-52083 Race condition with `application-identification`:** Resolved a race condition on systems with 4 cores and 8GB RAM running `application-identification` resulting in a failure of packet forwarding.
------
- **WAN-1471 Cannot distinguish between an SSR installed with OTP ISO and IBU image:** The `show system version` PCLI command now clarifies image-based or ISO in the summary view as well as the detail view.

### Caveats

- **I95-52426 Incorrect behavior when configuring an IDP custom rule definition:** In a case where a user is modifying a rule to **decrease** the action type, for example, the action `close-tcp-connection` is downgraded to `alert`, this may impact other rules, and some attacks may pass through undetected. 

  **Example:** If `HTTP:SQL:INJ:HEADER-1` is excluded from the ruleset, some other `HTTP` attacks may pass through undetected. **This behavior only occurs when decreasing the action type in the rule;** i.e.; the action `close-tcp-connection` is downgraded to `alert`. 

  This issue is actively being addressed, and will be resolved in an upcoming patch release. If you need to use this specific functionality, we recommend avoiding this configuration and waiting for the SSR 6.1.5 patch release.
------
- **I95-53777 Multicast traffic not passing after HA Failover:** High Availability with Multicast is not fully supported. Drop or complete loss of traffic may be seen when the primary node resumes traffic after a node failure and failover.

## Release 6.1.3-4

**Release Date:** May 22, 2023

### Resolved Issues

- **I95-48931 Service area Highway crash:** Now prevents crashing in SSR's highway process in unusual race conditions when a session's flow is removed before the session is fully established.
------
- **I95-50722 Highway crashes during session migration:** Resolved a crash in the SSR's highway process, due to a race condition between configuration changes and BFD sessions.
------
- **I95-51364 Highway crash on both nodes of an HA system:** Resolved a crash that can occur in the highway process of the SSR when deployed in HA mode, due to spurious redundancy database errors.
------
- **I95-51378 REST API improvements:** Performance improvements have been made in the metrics REST APIs to alleviate issues with intermittent metrics graphs on heavily loaded systems.
------
- **WAN-1958 Mist agent crashes:** Increased internal file system limits which were preventing some services from starting correctly at boot. Limits were raised based on expected system usage. 

## Release 6.1.2-7

**Release Date:** May 12, 2023

### Resolved Issues Requiring Configuration Changes

- **I95-48862 Load balance sessions across BGP RIB Entries with multiple paths:** Resolved an issue when BGP was used to build a routing table, only the first next hop was used. All next hops are now used, and load balancing occurs over all routing protocol routes. 
------
- **I95-50510 New fields for IPFIX:** The SSR IPFIX implementation was not sending the industry standard fields of `flowStartMilliseconds` and `flowEndMilliseconds`. In the new implementation, all IPFIX records include these fields. The start time is set to the start time of the flow, and the end time is always set to the time the last packet was received on the flow. For intermediate records, this indicates that the flow is still ongoing but provides the last activity timestamp. For the end records, this indicates when the last packet was received on the flow prior to the session terminating. For additional information, see [IPFIX](concepts_application_discovery.md#ipfix). 
---
- **I95-50571 Add packet buffer tracking to help analyze buffer exhaustion:** The following features have been added to help diagnose frequent packet buffer pool depletions in customer environments:
  - Track packet buffer locations. 
  - Enforce setting of packet location.
  - Add the ability to walk packet buffer pools, count the locations, and display. 

### Resolved Issues

- **The following CVE's have been identified and addressed in this release:** I95-50535, I95-50790.
------
- **I95-47776 Tank hostname parsing errors:** Resolved two issues in the Tank instance where the localhost could not resolve to an IP address, and Tank was not identifying non-default ports. These issues have been resolved. 
------
- **I95-48518 Application Identification not recognizing Apps on HA systems:** Resolved an issue where the GUI was only pulling Application data from one node in an HA configuration. Application ID Summary display now aggregates data from both nodes.
------
- **I95-49594 Highway Crash:** Resolved an issue for systems where any of the following are configured:
  - `application-identification` is enabled, 
  - a service is defined with `domain-name child services`, or 
  - a `service address` is configured as a `domain`
and there are established flows for any of these services, a link flap triggering a flow invalidation (changes to FIB) will induce a crash in the highway process of the SSR. This issue exists in versions 6.1.0 and 6.1.1, and is resolved in 6.1.2.
------
- **I95-49603 Process Manager crash:** When a long running process was being cleaned up by the subprocess, the cleanup would fail causing a crash. Long running processes are now properly terminated, which allows the cleanup subprocess to complete correctly. 
------
- **I95-49754 Waypoint re-use causing duplicate reverse flows:** Resolved a case where when the waypoint pool is nearly depleted, released waypoints were reused prematurely causing errors when installing reverse flows.
------
- **I95-49969 Permission Denied error when attempting to self-generate a webserver certificate:** Resolved an issue that prevented users with the admin role from creating a new self-signed web certificate via the PCLI command `create certificate self-signed webserver`.
------
- **I95-49974 Stuck flow not cleared when reverse metadata is incomplete:** Resolved an issue where reverse metadata is coming through incomplete - without the source tenant. The source tenant has been added to the reverse metadata.
------
- **I95-50363 MOS Metrics not refreshing:** Resolved an issue where the SLA and MOS values were not being updated in the stats (or PeerPathTable) when a BFD session was brought down. The SLA and MOS stats are now set to 0 when the BFD session is brought down.
------
- **I95-50543 systemd unable to start 128T after upgrade:** This issue has been resolved by ensuring that the netfilter kernel is installed.
------
- **I95-50710 Configuration cannot be applied to router when its time is ahead of the conductor:** Implemented time detection for configurations using a future time that is corrected upon commit. This resulted in an `mtime` older than what is in the datastore, and the configurations were rejected.
------
- **I95-50736 SSH key change not propogated to secondary conductor:** Resolved an issue where an SSH key change to `/etc/128technology/ssh/pdc_ssh_key` was not automatically detected and resynced between peer node and conductor nodes. 
------
- **I95-50778 Event History filter not working:** Resolved an issue where searching on the Event History page didn't show matching results when the search string is only found in the **Details** column.
------
- **I95-50823 Support for time-offset DHCP option:** `int-32 encoded-type` has been added to provide support for the time-offset DHCP option.
------
- **I95-50834 NodeMonitor crash on 128T startup when hardware interface is missing:** Resolved a `NodeMonitor` crash when the interface configuration is not present. 
------
- **I95-50967 SSR is not allowing other DHCP relay traffic to pass through:** When the SSR acts as a DHCP Relay, it will no longer drop packets received from other relay agents on the network. Instead the packets will be routed appropriately as per the configured policies.
------
- **I95-50977 Installer fails to download software when the Conductor software proxy is enabled:** Resolved an issue where when the Conductor software proxy is being used, DNF transactions to the conductor repo go through the proxy, despite the repo pointing to a local tunnel to the conductor. These transactions now go through the proper tunnel. 
------
- **I95-50979 Routers remain in connected state:** Resolved an issue where assets will perform a new highstate unnecessarily if a commit occurs while a highstate is already in progress, causing assets to take a long time to get to the running state.
------
- **I95-51006 Nodes stuck in connected state after upgrade:** On an HA conductor, if the user is performing an upgrade on the first conductor node and that user makes a config commit during the upgrade, then the configuration's modified time will become out of sync between the two conductor nodes. When the conductor first node is finished upgrading the result is a loop where the configuration keeps getting committed by each node back and forth until a new commit is made. This issue has been resolved by allowing the peer conductor node to accept the config despite the perceived version disparity. Please note performing a commit mid upgrade is not supported. 
------
- **I95-51007 Conductor is incorrectly honoring core pinning:** The cpuProperties cores setting in /etc/128technology/local.init was erroneously isolating cores on conductor nodes when set, even though this setting is intended for a router. This would cause a reduction in available processing cores for normal conductor operations. This setting will now be ignored on the conductor.
------
- **I95-51021 Package to Image conversion fails on FIPS enabled SSR:** Conversion of `package-based` to `image-based` is now supported for systems with FIPS 140-2 mode enabled.
------
- **I95-51044 Hide `forwarding-core-mode` on conductor:** Disabled the `forwarding-core-mode` setting on conductor nodes, since this setting doesn't apply to conductor.
------

### Caveats

- **I95-51087 SSR fails to download firmware after upgrading the conductor:** An issue has been identified where the first time a conductor is upgraded and **conductor-only** is selected in the software-update settings. The proxy service on the conductor does not work correctly, and downloads attempted by the router will fail. This issue will be resolved in the next release. 

  **_Workaround:_** Make a simple configuration change and commit the change. Any configuration change is sufficient to start the internal proxy service. Once this commit has been made this will no longer be an issue.

## Release 6.1.1-6

**Release Date:** April 28, 2023

### Resolved Issues

- **I95-48965, I95-50070, I95-51086 Race condition with routing updates inducing crash in highway process:** Resolved an issue where a routing change that affects the `forwarding-table` can incur a race condition with sessions completing and being removed, which could lead to a highway crash and restart.
------
- **I95-51052 NAT changes in network may cause sessions to fail:** If `session-scaling` is set to `enabled` with `outbound-only`, and a NAT between the routers causes an address and/or port change for existing TCP or UDP sessions between them, the SSR may not automatically recover idle or one-way traffic sessions. <br/>
The impacted sessions will time out when all packets for the failed sessions stop. New sessions are not impacted, nor are any pre-existing sessions with regular bi-directional traffic.
------
- **I95-51093 Race condition in `session-scaling` can cause crash/restart:** Resolved an issue when `session-scaling` is set to `enabled` together with `outbound-only`, a race condition can cause a crash and restart of the `highway` process in the SSR.

## Release 6.1.0-55

**Release Date:** April 14, 2023

### New Features

- **I95-21086 Traceroute:** Traceroute is implemented as a troubleshooting tool, allowing you to debug connectivity from point to point. For more information, see [Traceroute.](ts_traceroute.md)
------
- **I95-38746 [`show arp [<verbosity>]`](cli_reference.md#show-arp):** Added the `<verbosity>` subcommand to provide additional information, including time to next refresh (ms), retry count (if expired), and time of last resolved ARP.
------
- **I95-40660 Kernel Upgrade:** The OS kernel has been upgraded to address several CVEs and provide support for the i225 NIC, Wireguard, and Cordoba. 
------
- **I95-40130 Create factory defaults for all router-conductor communication:** SaltStack, Conductor, and IKE default session-types have been added. For new deployments, SIP, SIPS, and IPSEC-NAT use NAT Keep Alive by default, and the timeout for IPSEC-NAT is now 5 seconds.
------
- **I95-41728 Session Recovery Detection:** `session recovery detection` provides an effective monitoring method for session recovery. When `inactivity-based detection` is enabled, the originating node monitors activity on the flow, and takes action if no activity is detected for a specified time. For additional information, see [Session Recovery Detection.](config_session_recovery.md)
------
- **I95-42282 Highlight errors in Template:** Highlighting has been added for errors found in a template, making it easier to find.
------
- **I95-42379 BGP over SVR global service policy:** [Security and Service Policy](config_bgp.md#security-policy-and-service-policy) configuration options are provided for specifying the policy to be used for generated BGP-over-SVR services. 
------
- **I95-42483 STEP Diagnostics in GUI:** A Debug table and Replay visualization have been added to aid in STEP diagnostics. 
------
- **I95-44456 Support for DHCP vendor options:** DHCP options are now configurable on the SSR from the Mist dashboard. 
------

------
- **I95-50247 Duplicate peer path alarms:** Resolved an issue where both BFD and the path MTU feature were generating alarms for the same peer path being down. The criteria for which peerPath state changes can trigger peer path events has been tightened.
------
- **I95-50260 `show idp events` does not honor the `router` or `node` arguments:** Resolved an issue where `show idp events` did not honor the `router` and `node` arguments and always executed against the local node. The command is now executed correctly, using the specified arguments.
------
- **I95-50262 Unconnected routers not rotating logs often enough:** Resolved an issue where a managed router was not able to pull down the configuration from the Conductor - which includes the log rotation config. The default salt log rotation configuration has been improved, preventing the log from growing too large before the connection to the Conductor can be established.
