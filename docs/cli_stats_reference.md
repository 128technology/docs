This reference is better understood if you know the basics of how to operate the PCLI. If you have not used the PCLI before, it is beneficial to first read [the basics about the PCLI](concepts_pcli.md).

The _show stats_ command, and its myriad of subcommands, retrieve statistical data from various functions within the SSR and return them to the user. Used for troubleshooting, debugging configuration, or just to monitor the health and well-being of the SSR, these show commands provide a wealth of information and insight to users of the software.

The _show stats_ command provides the ability to set a "zero point" for displaying statistical output using the _since_ command. The _since_ command takes either a timestamp as its argument (in ISO 8601 format), or the keyword _launch_, which shows statistics accumulated since the SSR software was launched. For more information on the zero point, refer to the section of this guide on _set context stats_.

Generally speaking, the statistical data available via the SSR's PCLI is organized into a tree-like hierarchy, with each subcommand potentially having its own series of subcommands. By omitting the (optional) subcommands, the SSR will summarize all data from all possible subcommands and present it in a summary table; while this is very convenient to show a lot of potential data at a glance, it does incur additional processing overhead, and the retrieval of statistics may take an inordinately long time.

Each of the various _show stats_ subcommands will be described in sections that follow.

## `show stats`

## `show stats aggregate-session by-device-interface tcp-resets-received-reverse`

Total TCP resets received for active sessions in the reverse direction (resets per second) (in-memory)

#### Usage

```
show stats aggregate-session by-device-interface tcp-resets-received-reverse [device-interface <device-interface>] [since <since>] [force] [router <router>] [<verbosity>]
```

##### Keyword Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| device-interface | The name of the device interface generating this metric (comma-separated list) |
| force | Skip confirmation prompt. Only required when targeting all routers |
| router | The router for which to display stats (default: &lt;current router&gt;) |
| since | The displayed stats will be calculated as a delta from the given time. The given time can either be a timestamp or a delta, such as 45m, 1d, or 1mo. Providing &quot;launch&quot; ensures that no start time for the delta is set [type: timestamp] |
