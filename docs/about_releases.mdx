:::info
Issues resolved in a release are merged into subsequent releases chronologically AND lexicographically. 

For example, issues resolved in `4.3.12`, which was released on 3/12/2021, are resolved in `4.5.6`, which was released on 3/26/2021 and also resolved in `5.1.0`, which was released on 3/15/2021, and so on.

However, issues resolved in `4.3.12`, which was released on 3/12/2021 are not addressed in `4.5.5` because `4.5.5` was released on 2/10/2021. Even though `4.5.5` is lexicographically higher than `4.3.12`, it is chronologically older than 4.3.12.
:::

The SSR software follows a semantic versioning scheme. Semantic versioning is a simple scheme built around the `name-X.Y.Z-build` concept. `X` is incremented for every major release. A major release can be the introduction of major features or when backwards compatibility may be broken. `Y` is a minor release with solely non-breaking feature additions. `Z` is designated for bug fixes in previous releases. `-build` is used to denote the incremental process of development until the culmination in the final release.

Starting with version `5.4.0` the `-build` will reflect the number of iterations the release candidate went through prior to release. The build number will never increment once the software has been released. The build number will be included in the release notes for the respective version.

Version `6.1.0` introduces changes to the SSR software release model. Every six months, a new SSR software stream (i.e., bump in Major or Minor) will be released. Each software stream will have three phases of release - R1, followed by R2, followed by a final release. Initial feature content will be known as R1 (Release candidate 1). R1 will be followed by additional feature content three months later in an R2 (Release candidate 2). Between R1 and R2, there will be patch releases that only contain bug fixes. Once R2 is released, a customer must upgrade to R2 to remain on the same stream and address any defects identified in R1. Three months following R2, the release will be designated as either Short Term Support (STS) or Long Term Support (LTS). Every other release stream will be designated as LTS (Long Term Support).
