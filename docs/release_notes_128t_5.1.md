## Release 5.1.0

:::warning
SSH Root Login is not permitted. 

Before upgrading, ensure that there is at least one user on each 128T system that has sudo privileges. Failure to do so may result in the loss of remote management connectivity to the 128T Networking Platform. Please see the [Installation Overview](intro_installation.md) for additional information.

Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instances make it possible to maintain multiple routing tables with overlapping address spaces in one router.
------
- **I95-21776 Ethernet Over SVR Support:**
------

------
- **[I95-35051 Provide a way to generate & stage all auto-generated configuration](cli_reference.md#create-config-autogenerated):** The `create-config autogenerated` command has been added, which forces re-generation of all automatically generated configuration items, and stages the configuration changes into the current candidate configuration.Â This command serves only to aid in debugging, and allows you to validate, inspect, and make edits, without committing the changes.
