## Release 5.1.0

### New Features and Improvements 

- **[I95-19132 Role-Based Access Control](config_RBAC.md):** Role-Based Access Control provides a mechanism for an Administrator to create Access Management Roles that allow specific access to 128T resources such as routers, tenants, services, and other Authority-level configuration objects, as well as actions such as install, upgrade, or download.  
------
- **[I95-21775 BGP VRF Support:](concepts_learning_VRF_routes.md)** Support for learning VRF routes through BGP and the associated routing tables has been added. Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instances make it possible to maintain multiple routing tables with overlapping address spaces in one router.
------
- **[I95-21776 Ethernet Over SVR Support:](concepts_EthOverSVR.md)** Ethernet Over SVR (EoSVR) is a proprietary 128 Technology protocol that extends the Ethernet broadcast domain across multiple sites. EoSVR provides a site to site ethernet broadcast domain between 128T routers with increased security and efficiency, without the overhead of IP packet encapsulation.
------
- **I95-23206 Custom Chart Legends:** This feature allows the user to assign a custom series name to each trace in the legend by hovering over the series name, and clicking on the displayed icon. The pop up dialog allows you to assign a name to the series.
------
- **I95-24412 Dual PPPoE Per Node Support:** [Multiple PPPoE interfaces can be configured on a single node.](howto_config_PPPoE.md)
------
- **I95-27678 [Configurable Audit Events](config_audit_event.md):** Audit events such as traffic, admin, and system can be configured with this feature. The persistence of those events is now configurable.
------
- **I95-33016 Router and Node Page Dynamically Refresh Analytics and State:** Router and Node pages automatically refresh data at 30 second intervals. 
------
- **I95-33385 Implement dark-mode in GUI:** There is a switch in the User Profile under Preferences allowing a user to switch the display to "dark mode"; a black background with light text. 
------
- **I95-34919 Show Commands for Services:** The [`show service path`](cli_reference.md#show-service-path) and [`show fib`](cli_reference.md#show-fib) commands have been enhanced to provide more granular path-related debugging. 
------
- **[I95-35051 Provide a way to generate & stage all auto-generated configuration](cli_reference.md#create-config-autogenerated):** The `create-config autogenerated` command has been added, which forces re-generation of all automatically generated configuration items, and stages the configuration changes into the current candidate configuration.Â This command serves only to aid in debugging, and allows you to validate, inspect, and make edits, without committing the changes.
------
- **I95-35952 PCLI support for multi-line fields:** Configurations with multi-line input fields are restricted to a single line when displayed. 
------
- **[I95-36118 Add a command to compare running/candidate config to an exported config](cli_reference.md#compare-config):** Added the ability to specify _a previously exported configuration file_ to compare against the running or candidate config allows you to compare configurations **without** having to import the exported config into the candidate config for comparison. 
------
- **I95-36912 PCLI commands accept resource-group wherever possible:** Commands that can specify `router` all on the conductor can now target a resource group using the new `group` argument. `router` and `group` are mutually exclusive, so only one can be specified at a time.

------
- **I95-38212 Restart System From the Node Panel:** The Process Management button has been added to the top of the Node Panel in the GUI. When selected, a list of operations displays, allowing the user to; Start, Stop, or Restart the 128T Conductor or Router. The option to Reboot the OS is also available.
------
- **I95-38514 View User Activity:** Added a user activity table to the GUI on the Users page, as well as adding a new [PCLI command `show user activity`](cli_reference.md/#show-user-activity).
