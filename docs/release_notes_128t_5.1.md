## Release 5.1.0

:::warning
SSH Root Login is not permitted. 

Before upgrading, ensure that there is at least one user on each 128T system that has sudo privileges. Failure to do so may result in the loss of remote management connectivity to the 128T Networking Platform. Please see the [Installation Overview](intro_installation.md) for additional information.

### New Features and Improvements 

- **[I95-19132 Role-Based Access Control](config_RBAC.md):** Role-Based Access Control provides a mechanism for an Administrator to create Access Management Roles that allow specific access to 128T resources such as routers, tenants, and services, as well as other Authority-level configuration objects.  
------
- **[I95-21775 BGP VRF Support:](concepts_learning_VRF_routes.md)** Support for learning VRF routes through BGP and the associated routing tables has been added. Virtual Routing and Forwarding (VRF) instances make it possible to maintain multiple routing tables with overlapping address spaces in one router.
------
- **I95-21776 Ethernet Over SVR Support:**
------
- **I95-24412 Dual PPPoE Per Node Support:** [Multiple PPPoE interfaces can be configured on a single node.](howto_config_PPPoE.md)
------
- **I95-27678 Send Audit Events to SYSLOG Server(s):** Audit and alarm events can now be pushed to syslog and other services via the Monitoring Agent. 
------
- **I95-33016 Router and Node Page Dynamically Refresh Analytics and State:** Router and Node pages automatically refresh data at 30 second intervals. 
------
- **I95-33385 Implement dark-mode in GUI:** There is a switch available through the GUI allowing a user to switch the display to "dark mode"; black background with light text. 
------
- **I95-34919 Show Commands for Services:** The [`show service`](cli_reference.md#show-service), [`show service path`](cli_reference.md#show-service-path), and [`show fib`](cli_reference.md#show-fib) commands have been enhanced to provide more granular path-related debugging. 
------
- **[I95-35051 Provide a way to generate & stage all auto-generated configuration](cli_reference.md#create-config-autogenerated):** The `create-config autogenerated` command has been added, which forces re-generation of all automatically generated configuration items, and stages the configuration changes into the current candidate configuration.Â This command serves only to aid in debugging, and allows you to validate, inspect, and make edits, without committing the changes.
------
- **I95-35952 PCLI support for multi-line fields:** Configurations with multi-line input fields are restricted to a single line when displayed. 
------
- **[I95-36118 Add a command to compare running/candidate config to an exported config](cli_reference.md#compare-config):** Added the ability to specify _a previously exported configuration file_ to compare against the running or candidate config allows you to compare configurations **without** having to import the exported config into the candidate config for comparison. 
------
- **I95-36912 PCLI commands accept resource-group wherever possible:** Commands that can specify `router` all on the conductor can now target a resource group using the new `group` argument. `router` and `group` are mutually exclusive, so only one can be specified at a time.
------
- **I95-37251 Provide an Interface description on hover:** An interface description is provided in the GUI on hover. 
------
- **I95-37443 Latency/Jitter/Loss chart:** A chart showing the latency, jitter, and loss for the selected peer path over time is accessible by clicking the **Source** field in the Peer Paths table on the Router page. 
------
- **I95-37473 PCLI: Advanced mode:** Advanced Mode allows viewing and editing configuration fields that are normally hidden and automatically generated by 128T. The new mode is invoked by passing `--user-mode=advanced` to the PCLI at launch.
------
- **I95-37663 GUI rebrand for managed service providers:** Authority now has a 'Theme' section that changes the primary color, secondary color, and main icon of the GUI.
------
- **I95-38212 Conductor should have a "reboot" button in GUI:** Added a Restart button on each node page. Clicking the button opens a dialog which asks the user to confirm the (full system) restart. 
------
- **I95-38642 Form Based Template Instantiation:**  An administrator can now define a JSON Schema to create a template for variables so a user can fill out the variables in a simple form.
------
