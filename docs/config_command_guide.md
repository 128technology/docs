## `configure authority conductor-address`

IP address or FQDN of the conductor

#### Usage

```
configure authority conductor-address [<hostv4>]
```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| hostv4 | Value to add to this list |

#### Description

##### hostv4 (union)

The host type represents either an IPv4 address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-address (string)

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

Length: 1-253

#### Description

##### ip-prefix (union)

The ip-prefix type represents an IP prefix and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-prefix (string)

The ipv4-prefix type represents an IPv4 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal to 32.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The canonical format of an IPv4 prefix has all bits of
the IPv4 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv4 prefix.

###### (1) ipv6-prefix (string)

The ipv6-prefix type represents an IPv6 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal 128.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The IPv6 address should have all bits that do not belong
to the prefix set to zero.

The canonical format of an IPv6 prefix has all bits of
the IPv6 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv6 prefix.  Furthermore, IPv6 address is represented
in the compressed format described in RFC 4291, Section
2.2, item 2 with the following additional rules: the ::
substitution must be applied to the longest sequence of
all-zero 16-bit chunks in an IPv6 address.  If there is
a tie, the first sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks is
replaced by ::.  Single all-zero 16-bit chunks are not

#### Usage

```
configure authority ipfix-collector ip-address [<host>]
```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| host | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### host (union) (required)

The host type represents either an IP address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ip-address (union) (required)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-address (string) (required):

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

####### (1) ipv6-address (string) (required):

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence
of all-zero 16-bit chunks is replaced by ::.  Single
all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

Must be a valid IPv6 address.
Must be a valid IPv6 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string) (required)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

Length: 1-253

#### Usage

```

```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| host | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### host (union) (required)

The host type represents either an IP address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ip-address (union) (required)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-address (string) (required):

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

####### (1) ipv6-address (string) (required):

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence
of all-zero 16-bit chunks is replaced by ::.  Single
all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

Must be a valid IPv6 address.
Must be a valid IPv6 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string) (required)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| port-number | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

Default: 1812

##### port-number (uint16)

The port-number type represents a 16-bit port number of an
Internet transport layer protocol such as UDP, TCP, DCCP, or
SCTP.  Port numbers are assigned by IANA.  A current list of
all assignments is available from &lt;http://www.iana.org/&gt;.

Note that the port number value zero is reserved by IANA.  In
situations where the value zero does not make sense, it can
be excluded by subtyping the port-number type.

In the value set and its semantics, this type is equivalent
to the InetPortNumber textual convention of the SMIv2.

Range: 0-65535

## `configure authority router conductor-address`

IP address or FQDN of the conductor

#### Usage

```
configure authority router conductor-address [<hostv4>]
```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| hostv4 | Value to add to this list |

#### Description

##### hostv4 (union)

The host type represents either an IPv4 address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-address (string)

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

Length: 1-253

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| ipv4-prefix | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

Default: 169.254.130.0/24

##### ipv4-prefix (string)

The ipv4-prefix type represents an IPv4 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal to 32.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The canonical format of an IPv4 prefix has all bits of
the IPv4 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv4 prefix.

| host | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### host (union)

The host type represents either an IP address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ip-address (union)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-address (string):

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

####### (1) ipv6-address (string):

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence
of all-zero 16-bit chunks is replaced by ::.  Single
all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

Must be a valid IPv6 address.
Must be a valid IPv6 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

Length: 1-253

##### ip-prefix (union)

The ip-prefix type represents an IP prefix and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-prefix (string)

The ipv4-prefix type represents an IPv4 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal to 32.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The canonical format of an IPv4 prefix has all bits of
the IPv4 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv4 prefix.

###### (1) ipv6-prefix (string)

The ipv6-prefix type represents an IPv6 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal 128.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The IPv6 address should have all bits that do not belong
to the prefix set to zero.

The canonical format of an IPv6 prefix has all bits of
the IPv6 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv6 prefix.  Furthermore, IPv6 address is represented
in the compressed format described in RFC 4291, Section
2.2, item 2 with the following additional rules: the ::
substitution must be applied to the longest sequence of
all-zero 16-bit chunks in an IPv6 address.  If there is
a tie, the first sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks is
replaced by ::.  Single all-zero 16-bit chunks are not
compressed.  The canonical format uses lowercase
characters and leading zeros are not allowed.

## `configure authority router node device-interface network-interface ethernet-over-svr peer ip-address`

The IP address or hostname of the LAN segment of peer router which is associated with the same eosvr-bridge name.

#### Usage

```
configure authority router node device-interface network-interface ethernet-over-svr peer ip-address [<host>]
```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| host | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### host (union)

The host type represents either an IP address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ip-address (union)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-address (string):

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

####### (1) ipv6-address (string):

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence
of all-zero 16-bit chunks is replaced by ::.  Single
all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

Must be a valid IPv6 address.
Must be a valid IPv6 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

Length: 1-253

3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow

1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

| host | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### host (union)

The host type represents either an IP address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ip-address (union)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-address (string):

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

####### (1) ipv6-address (string):

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence

all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

Must be a valid IPv6 address.
Must be a valid IPv6 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

#### Description

##### host (union) (required)

The host type represents either an IP address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ip-address (union) (required)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-address (string) (required):

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

####### (1) ipv6-address (string) (required):

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence
of all-zero 16-bit chunks is replaced by ::.  Single
all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

Must be a valid IPv6 address.
Must be a valid IPv6 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string) (required)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

Length: 1-253

Must be a valid IPv6 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

##### host (union)

The host type represents either an IP address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ip-address (union)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-address (string):

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

####### (1) ipv6-address (string):

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence
of all-zero 16-bit chunks is replaced by ::.  Single
all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

Must be a valid IPv6 address.
Must be a valid IPv6 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

#### Description

##### ip-address (union)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-address (string)

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

###### (1) ipv6-address (string)

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence
of all-zero 16-bit chunks is replaced by ::.  Single
all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| ip-prefix | Value to add to this list |

#### Description

##### ip-prefix (union)

The ip-prefix type represents an IP prefix and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-prefix (string)

The ipv4-prefix type represents an IPv4 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal to 32.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The canonical format of an IPv4 prefix has all bits of
the IPv4 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv4 prefix.

###### (1) ipv6-prefix (string)

The ipv6-prefix type represents an IPv6 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal 128.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The IPv6 address should have all bits that do not belong
to the prefix set to zero.

The canonical format of an IPv6 prefix has all bits of
the IPv6 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv6 prefix.  Furthermore, IPv6 address is represented
in the compressed format described in RFC 4291, Section
2.2, item 2 with the following additional rules: the ::
substitution must be applied to the longest sequence of
all-zero 16-bit chunks in an IPv6 address.  If there is
a tie, the first sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks is
replaced by ::.  Single all-zero 16-bit chunks are not
compressed.  The canonical format uses lowercase
characters and leading zeros are not allowed.

###### (0) ipv4-prefix (string)

The ipv4-prefix type represents an IPv4 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal to 32.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The canonical format of an IPv4 prefix has all bits of
the IPv4 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv4 prefix.

###### (1) ipv6-prefix (string)

The ipv6-prefix type represents an IPv6 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal 128.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The IPv6 address should have all bits that do not belong
to the prefix set to zero.

The canonical format of an IPv6 prefix has all bits of
the IPv6 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv6 prefix.  Furthermore, IPv6 address is represented
in the compressed format described in RFC 4291, Section
2.2, item 2 with the following additional rules: the ::
substitution must be applied to the longest sequence of
all-zero 16-bit chunks in an IPv6 address.  If there is
a tie, the first sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks is
replaced by ::.  Single all-zero 16-bit chunks are not
compressed.  The canonical format uses lowercase
characters and leading zeros are not allowed.

#### Description

##### ip-prefix (union)

The ip-prefix type represents an IP prefix and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-prefix (string)

The ipv4-prefix type represents an IPv4 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal to 32.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The canonical format of an IPv4 prefix has all bits of
the IPv4 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv4 prefix.

###### (1) ipv6-prefix (string)

The ipv6-prefix type represents an IPv6 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal 128.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The IPv6 address should have all bits that do not belong
to the prefix set to zero.

The canonical format of an IPv6 prefix has all bits of
the IPv6 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv6 prefix.  Furthermore, IPv6 address is represented
in the compressed format described in RFC 4291, Section
2.2, item 2 with the following additional rules: the ::
substitution must be applied to the longest sequence of
all-zero 16-bit chunks in an IPv6 address.  If there is
a tie, the first sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks is
replaced by ::.  Single all-zero 16-bit chunks are not
compressed.  The canonical format uses lowercase
characters and leading zeros are not allowed.

| ip-prefix | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### ip-prefix (union)

The ip-prefix type represents an IP prefix and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-prefix (string)

The ipv4-prefix type represents an IPv4 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal to 32.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The canonical format of an IPv4 prefix has all bits of
the IPv4 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv4 prefix.

###### (1) ipv6-prefix (string)

The ipv6-prefix type represents an IPv6 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal 128.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The IPv6 address should have all bits that do not belong
to the prefix set to zero.

The canonical format of an IPv6 prefix has all bits of
the IPv6 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv6 prefix.  Furthermore, IPv6 address is represented
in the compressed format described in RFC 4291, Section
2.2, item 2 with the following additional rules: the ::
substitution must be applied to the longest sequence of
all-zero 16-bit chunks in an IPv6 address.  If there is
a tie, the first sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks is
replaced by ::.  Single all-zero 16-bit chunks are not
compressed.  The canonical format uses lowercase
characters and leading zeros are not allowed.

##### as-number (uint32)

The as-number type represents autonomous system numbers
which identify an Autonomous System (AS).  An AS is a set
of routers under a single technical administration, using

packets within the AS, and using an exterior gateway
protocol to route packets to other ASs&#x27;.  IANA maintains
the AS number space and has delegated large parts to the
regional registries.

Autonomous system numbers were originally limited to 16
bits.  BGP extensions have enlarged the autonomous system
number space to 32 bits.  This type therefore uses an uint32
base type without a range restriction in order to support
a larger autonomous system number space.

In the value set and its semantics, this type is equivalent
to the InetAutonomousSystemNumber textual convention of
the SMIv2.

| ip-prefix | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### ip-prefix (union)

The ip-prefix type represents an IP prefix and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-prefix (string)

The ipv4-prefix type represents an IPv4 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal to 32.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The canonical format of an IPv4 prefix has all bits of
the IPv4 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv4 prefix.

###### (1) ipv6-prefix (string)

The ipv6-prefix type represents an IPv6 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal 128.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The IPv6 address should have all bits that do not belong
to the prefix set to zero.

The canonical format of an IPv6 prefix has all bits of
the IPv6 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv6 prefix.  Furthermore, IPv6 address is represented
in the compressed format described in RFC 4291, Section
2.2, item 2 with the following additional rules: the ::
substitution must be applied to the longest sequence of
all-zero 16-bit chunks in an IPv6 address.  If there is
a tie, the first sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks is
replaced by ::.  Single all-zero 16-bit chunks are not
compressed.  The canonical format uses lowercase
characters and leading zeros are not allowed.

```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| ip-prefix | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### ip-prefix (union)

The ip-prefix type represents an IP prefix and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-prefix (string)

The ipv4-prefix type represents an IPv4 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal to 32.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The canonical format of an IPv4 prefix has all bits of
the IPv4 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv4 prefix.

###### (1) ipv6-prefix (string)

The ipv6-prefix type represents an IPv6 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal 128.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The IPv6 address should have all bits that do not belong
to the prefix set to zero.

The canonical format of an IPv6 prefix has all bits of
the IPv6 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv6 prefix.  Furthermore, IPv6 address is represented
in the compressed format described in RFC 4291, Section
2.2, item 2 with the following additional rules: the ::
substitution must be applied to the longest sequence of
all-zero 16-bit chunks in an IPv6 address.  If there is
a tie, the first sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks is
replaced by ::.  Single all-zero 16-bit chunks are not
compressed.  The canonical format uses lowercase
characters and leading zeros are not allowed.

```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| as-number | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### as-number (uint32)

The as-number type represents autonomous system numbers
which identify an Autonomous System (AS).  An AS is a set
of routers under a single technical administration, using
an interior gateway protocol and common metrics to route
packets within the AS, and using an exterior gateway
protocol to route packets to other ASs&#x27;.  IANA maintains
the AS number space and has delegated large parts to the
regional registries.

Autonomous system numbers were originally limited to 16
bits.  BGP extensions have enlarged the autonomous system
number space to 32 bits.  This type therefore uses an uint32
base type without a range restriction in order to support
a larger autonomous system number space.

In the value set and its semantics, this type is equivalent
to the InetAutonomousSystemNumber textual convention of
the SMIv2.

| hostv4 | Value to add to this list |

#### Description

##### hostv4 (union)

The host type represents either an IPv4 address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-address (string)

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

Length: 1-253

domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

#### Description

##### ip-address (union) (required)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-address (string) (required)

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

###### (1) ipv6-address (string) (required)

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence
of all-zero 16-bit chunks is replaced by ::.  Single
all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| host | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### host (union)

The host type represents either an IP address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ip-address (union)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-address (string):

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

####### (1) ipv6-address (string):

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence
of all-zero 16-bit chunks is replaced by ::.  Single
all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

Must be a valid IPv6 address.
Must be a valid IPv6 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

Length: 1-253

## `configure authority router system ntp server ip-address`

#### Usage

```
configure authority router system ntp server ip-address [<host>]
```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| host | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### host (union)

The host type represents either an IP address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ip-address (union)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-address (string):

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

####### (1) ipv6-address (string):

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence
of all-zero 16-bit chunks is replaced by ::.  Single
all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

Must be a valid IPv6 address.
Must be a valid IPv6 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

Length: 1-253

```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| host | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### host (union)

The host type represents either an IP address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ip-address (union)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-address (string):

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

####### (1) ipv6-address (string):

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be

all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

Must be a valid IPv6 address.
Must be a valid IPv6 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

Length: 1-253

## `configure authority router system syslog server ip-address`

The address of remote syslog server.

#### Usage

```
configure authority router system syslog server ip-address [<host>]
```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| host | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### host (union)

The host type represents either an IP address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ip-address (union)

The ip-address type represents an IP address and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-address (string):

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

####### (1) ipv6-address (string):

The ipv6-address type represents an IPv6 address in full,
mixed, shortened, and shortened-mixed notation.

The canonical format of IPv6 addresses uses the compressed
format described in RFC 4291, Section 2.2, item 2 with the
following additional rules: the :: substitution must be
applied to the longest sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks
in an IPv6 address.  If there is a tie, the first sequence
of all-zero 16-bit chunks is replaced by ::.  Single
all-zero 16-bit chunks are not compressed.  The canonical
format uses lowercase characters and leading zeros are
not allowed.

Must be a valid IPv6 address.
Must be a valid IPv6 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

Length: 1-253

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| as-number | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### as-number (uint32)

The as-number type represents autonomous system numbers
which identify an Autonomous System (AS).  An AS is a set
of routers under a single technical administration, using
an interior gateway protocol and common metrics to route
packets within the AS, and using an exterior gateway
protocol to route packets to other ASs&#x27;.  IANA maintains
the AS number space and has delegated large parts to the
regional registries.

Autonomous system numbers were originally limited to 16
bits.  BGP extensions have enlarged the autonomous system
number space to 32 bits.  This type therefore uses an uint32
base type without a range restriction in order to support
a larger autonomous system number space.

In the value set and its semantics, this type is equivalent
to the InetAutonomousSystemNumber textual convention of
the SMIv2.

The ipv4-prefix type represents an IPv4 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal to 32.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most

in the compressed format described in RFC 4291, Section
2.2, item 2 with the following additional rules: the ::
substitution must be applied to the longest sequence of
all-zero 16-bit chunks in an IPv6 address.  If there is
a tie, the first sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks is
replaced by ::.  Single all-zero 16-bit chunks are not
compressed.  The canonical format uses lowercase
characters and leading zeros are not allowed.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ip-prefix (union)

The ip-prefix type represents an IP prefix and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-prefix (string):

The ipv4-prefix type represents an IPv4 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal to 32.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The ipv6-prefix type represents an IPv6 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal 128.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The IPv6 address should have all bits that do not belong
to the prefix set to zero.

The canonical format of an IPv6 prefix has all bits of
the IPv6 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv6 prefix.  Furthermore, IPv6 address is represented
in the compressed format described in RFC 4291, Section
2.2, item 2 with the following additional rules: the ::
substitution must be applied to the longest sequence of
all-zero 16-bit chunks in an IPv6 address.  If there is
a tie, the first sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks is
replaced by ::.  Single all-zero 16-bit chunks are not
compressed.  The canonical format uses lowercase
characters and leading zeros are not allowed.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492

Length: 1-253

The ip-prefix type represents an IP prefix and is IP version neutral. The format of the textual representations implies the IP version.

Must be one of the following types:

####### (0) ipv4-prefix (string):

The ipv4-prefix type represents an IPv4 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal to 32.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address
mask that has n contiguous 1-bits from the most
significant bit (MSB) and all other bits set to 0.

The canonical format of an IPv4 prefix has all bits of
the IPv4 address set to zero that are not part of the
IPv4 prefix.

####### (1) ipv6-prefix (string):

The ipv6-prefix type represents an IPv6 address prefix.
The prefix length is given by the number following the
slash character and must be less than or equal 128.

A prefix length value of n corresponds to an IP address

IPv6 prefix.  Furthermore, IPv6 address is represented
in the compressed format described in RFC 4291, Section
2.2, item 2 with the following additional rules: the ::
substitution must be applied to the longest sequence of
all-zero 16-bit chunks in an IPv6 address.  If there is
a tie, the first sequence of all-zero 16-bit chunks is
replaced by ::.  Single all-zero 16-bit chunks are not
compressed.  The canonical format uses lowercase
characters and leading zeros are not allowed.

Address of the STEP server. This could be the IP address/FQDN of the Conductor, standalone server or router where the STEP server is hosted.

#### Usage

```
configure authority step-repo address [<hostv4>]
```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| hostv4 | The value to set for this field |

#### Description

##### hostv4 (union)

The host type represents either an IPv4 address or a DNS domain name.

Must be one of the following types:

###### (0) ipv4-address (string)

The ipv4-address type represents an IPv4 address in dotted-quad notation.

Must be a valid IPv4 address.

###### (1) domain-name (string)

The domain-name type represents a DNS domain name.  The
name SHOULD be fully qualified whenever possible.

Internet domain names are only loosely specified.  Section
3.5 of RFC 1034 recommends a syntax (modified in Section
2.1 of RFC 1123).  The pattern above is intended to allow
for current practice in domain name use, and some possible
future expansion.  It is designed to hold various types of
domain names, including names used for A or AAAA records
(host names) and other records, such as SRV records.  Note
that Internet host names have a stricter syntax (described
in RFC 952) than the DNS recommendations in RFCs 1034 and
1123, and that systems that want to store host names in
schema nodes using the domain-name type are recommended to
adhere to this stricter standard to ensure interoperability.

The encoding of DNS names in the DNS protocol is limited
to 255 characters.  Since the encoding consists of labels
prefixed by a length bytes and there is a trailing NULL
byte, only 253 characters can appear in the textual dotted
notation.

The description clause of schema nodes using the domain-name
type MUST describe when and how these names are resolved to
IP addresses.  Note that the resolution of a domain-name value
may require to query multiple DNS records (e.g., A for IPv4
and AAAA for IPv6).  The order of the resolution process and
which DNS record takes precedence can either be defined
explicitely or it may depend on the configuration of the
resolver.

Domain-name values use the US-ASCII encoding.  Their canonical
format uses lowercase US-ASCII characters.  Internationalized
domain names MUST be encoded in punycode as described in RFC
3492
