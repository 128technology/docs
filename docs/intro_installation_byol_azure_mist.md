This guide describes the process for deploying a Mist-managed Session Smart Router (SSR) in Azure using your own license. When installed as an AWS image, SSR Version 6.x supports Mist-managed routers. The process consists of the following steps:

* [Selecting the Azure Plan](#selecting-the-azure-plan).
* Deploying a [Session Smart Router](#session-smart-router).

## Selecting the Azure Plan

**Bring Your Own License (BYOL):** This allows you to install your own licensed copy of the SSR software on an Azure VM. The device registration code is used to authenticate access to the Mist installation repositories.

For the latest information about SSR BYOL offereings, please refer to the [Cloud Images BYOL Release Notes](release_notes_byol.md).

Once you have selected the plan that best suits the needs of your deployment, proceed to the [Session Smart Router Deployment](#session-smart-router) to deploy a Session Smart Router.

## Session Smart Router

Use the following process to deploy a Mist-managed Session Smart Router in Azure.

### Requirements

The following infrastructure must exist in your Azure subscription:
* A VNet where the Session Smart Router (SSR) will be deployed.
* An Availability Set where the SSR will be deployed.
* The existing VNet is segmented with the following subnets. The role of each subnet is described below.

#### Public Subnet
This subnet must provide connectivity to enable communication with external/remote SSR peers as well as access to the Mist cloud infrastructure if no management subnet is provided.

#### Private Subnet
This subnet must provide connectivity to internal workloads within the cloud.

:::important
Please note that deploying Session Smart Routers without a valid token is limited to deployments within the cloud. If your use case also requires the deployment of an on-premises SSR, please contact your Juniper sales representative.
:::

#### [Optional] Management Subnet
This subnet must provide connectivity to the Mist cloud


## Deployment

A Session Smart Router can be deployed manually via the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com) or in an automated fashion using Azure CLI or PowerShell commands. This section describes both methods. Choose the method that better suits your needs.

When deploying the Session Smart Router using the templates referenced in this section, the following infrastructure elements are created automatically to assist with the deployment process:
* Virtual machine with the Session Smart image specified in the template.
* The router is deployed with three network interfaces: public, private, and optional management interfaces.
* Each network interface has a network security group associated. The network security groups are configured in accordance with the requirements to deploy a fabric with Session Smart Networking software.
* The public and management interfaces have a unique and static public IP address associated.

The following image shows the infrastructure elements deployed:

7. Create the parameters file.
8. Accept the terms of use and conditions of the image.
9. Launch the deployment with the corresponding Azure CLI or PowerShell commands, making use of the URL of the template identified previously. For additional information see [Launch the Template](#launch-the-template).

Once the deployment completes, information is provided in the Outputs tab on the left hand side.

The non-interactive, Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP) method is triggered. After the VM is deployed, it will take an additional 2-3 minutes for the ZTP process to complete. When the ZTP process concludes, there will be an asset in the Mist inventory to be associated with the router configuration. It will then take an additional 5-10 minutes for the desired SSR version to be installed.

### Cloud-init Onboarding
When launching an instance using CLI or Powershell or while using automation the following user-data section can be leveraged to setup the onboarding data for the instance.

```
#cloud-config
write_files:
  - path: /etc/128T-hardware-bootstrapper/onboarding-config.json
    content: |
      { "name": "<router-name>", "ssr-version": "<version>", "registration-code": "<regcode>", "mode": "mist-managed", "cloud-provider": "azure"}
```

| Option | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| name | The name of the router to use for Mist onboarding. By default, the instance name will be used. |
| registration-code | The Mist registration used for adoption of the instance to a Mist organization. |
| ssr-version | The SSR software version to be installed on the instance. |

### Manual Onboarding
If a user does not supply the onboarding configuration before launching the instance, the onboarding steps can be manually executed.

1. Log into the instance using the admin credentials provided when launching.
2. Run `/usr/libexec/hardwareBootstrapper128t config-generator`
3. Follow the prompts to generate and apply the onboarding configuration.

### Mist-Managed Setup

Once the instance is launched with the correct registration-code, the device will self-onboard to appropriate Mist organization. The process can take up to 5 minutes. The device is visible as Unassigned in the Mist organization once onboarding is complete.

### Network Interfaces Layout

The _Session Smart Router Template_ deploys a VM for the SSR with three network interfaces. The template attaches the network interfaces to the VM in the following order: Public, Private, and Management. The network interfaces to be used in Mist configuration are as follows:

| Network Interface Name | Subnet           | Mist Config Name     |
| ---------------------- | ---------------- | ----------------|
| ge-0-0                   | Public           | ge-0/0/0    |
| ge-0-1                   | Private          | ge-0/0/1    |
| ge-0-2                   | Management          | Out Of Band Management   |


#### Interface Tagging

In addition to using the cloud formation template, the admin can tag the interface with the key `SSR-ROLE`. The possible values are as follows:

| Tag Value | Meaning |
| --------- | ------- |
| WAN       | Interface is marked as WAN for onboarding purposes and is assumed to have connectivity to Mist cloud infrastructure. |
| LAN       | Interface is marked as LAN and is assumed to be used as a private network for internal workflows. |
| MGMT       | Interface is marked as MGMT and is assumed to have connectivity to Mist cloud infrastructure. |

## Troubleshooting

### Device Does Not Exist In Mist after ZTP

Once the instance is launched with the correct registration-code, the device will self-onboard to appropriate Mist organization. The device is visible as Unassigned in the Mist organization once onboarding is complete. At this point, the SSR install process will begin. This process can take up to 15 minutes to complete.

If the device does not show up in the Mist organization or the desired SSR version was not installed after 15 minutes, SSH into the instance.

- Try to log into the pcli, run `su admin` and then `show mist`.

- If the pcli is not accessable or the status and necessary action is not obvious, capture the Hardware Bootstrapper tech support (`/var/log/128T-hardware-bootstrapper/hardware-bootstrapper-tech-support.zip`) and examine the journal for `128T-hardware-bootstrapper`, `ember`, and `128T-mist-agent`.

### Launch the Template

This section describes the parameters to complete the template to deploy a Mist-managed SSR using either the Azure marketplace, or programmatically.

![ARM Template](/img/azure-byol-template.png)

A description of the parameters of the template are listed in the following table:

| Parameter               | Description |
| ---| --- |
| Subscription            | Subscription for the deployment. |
| Resource group          | Select an existing resource group or create a new one. |
| Region                  | The first instance of the Region field is automatically populated with the region corresponding to the resource group. |
| Location                | As indicated in the requirements, the Session Smart Router is going to be deployed into an existing VNet. The Location field is the name of the location where such VNet exists. Please refer to the following list https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/global-infrastructure/locations (the name of the Location field is one word and all lowercase). Example: eastus, westus, westeurope, eastasia...     |
| Avaiability Set Name    | Name of the existing availability set within the same resource group and region as the VNet selected above the Session Smart  Router is going to be deployed to.          |
| Instance size        | Select the size of the VM in the field Instance Size. |
| Instance Name           | Provide a name to the VM for the Session Smart Router. |
| SSR Version | SSR software version installed on the instance. |
| Registration Code   | The Mist registration used for adoption of the instance to a Mist organization. |
| Managed Identity | The Azure Managed identity used to manage permissions for the router instance. |
| Virtual Network Name    | Name of the existing VNet where the Session Smart Router is going to be deployed to. |
| Public Subnet Name      | The name of the public subnet within the VNet. |
| Public Subnet Allowed CIDR     | It corresponds to the source IP CIDR range of the SSR/s at the data center/branch (outside the cloud) allowed to originate traffic to the public interface of the router. This field allows for defining a well defined and trusted IP address range. It is common to set this field to 0.0.0.0/0 for now, as the source IP addresses of the routers at the data center or branch (outside the cloud) are not known at this time. However, after the deployment and once these external IP addresses are known it is recommended to provision them in the corresponding security groups to increase the degree of security. |
| Admin Allowed CIDR      | Allows for restricting reachability to the management interface of the router to a well known source IP address CIDR range. Default is set to 0.0.0.0/0 allowing every IP address to reach the management interface. Once the deployment completes, it is highly recommended to update the configuration of the network security group to allow only access from the source IP address/es where the Session Smart Router will be administered. |
| Private Subnet Name     | The name of the private subnet within the VNet. |
| Private Subnet Allowed CIDR    | It corresponds to the source IP CIDR range of the internal workloads/endpoints allowed to originate traffic to the private interface of the router. This field allows for defining a well defined and trusted IP address range. By default is set to 0.0.0.0/0 to allow every workload/endpoint to communicate with the router.                                                                             |
| Management Subnet Name  | [OPTIONAL] The name of the management subnet within the VNet. |
| Admin Public Key Data| Paste in the field Admin Public Key Data the SSH public key to be used to authenticate with the VM (Linux) instance via SSH. The key needs to be at least 2048-bit and in ssh-rsa format. Please find the following an example of a valid key next (To reduce the length of the key in this example multiple character have been replaced by three dots): ```ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAACAQDHwB1Qe1KndGqKuT3F...GumfdHfdasy8N0kncMtp2wtkqoLsRWdJ4/WKaZBOrPd4Q== admin@Admin-MacBook-Pro.local```.
