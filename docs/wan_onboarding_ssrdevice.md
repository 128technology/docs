SSR device onboarding to the Mist cloud is a "zero-touch" process. After installing and powering up the hardware device, simply use your Mist Marvis AI App to scan the QR code on the back of the appliance. 

1. Log into the app and select your Organization.
2. Click on Claim device to Organization. The camera will open and allow you to scan the QR code on the device.
3. Scan the QR code. The device information is automatically populated to the app.
4. The unassigned device shows in the App. 
5. Click Edit and select the device.
6. If there are predefined sites in the Organization, select the site where the device will be associated. 
7. The device is now associated with the site, and into the Mist inventory. 
8. Return to the Mist UI to complete the onboarding process.
