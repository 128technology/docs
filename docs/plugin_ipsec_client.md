title: IPsec Client plugin
sidebar_label: IPsec Client
---

The 128T-ipsec-client plugin provides a way to send and encrypt traffic to IPsec endpoints through the 128T router. It is possible to configure the plugin for each router to have multiple destination IPsec endpoints and thus the 128T will failover between them. This is accomplished by performing a [Service Function Chain (SFC)](plugin_intro.md#service-function-chaining) with Libreswan, a third-party IPsec client. By enabling this plugin, you can provide IPsec tunnel connectivity to third party providers from your 128T router.

:::note
The instructions for installing and managing the plugin can be found [here](plugin_intro.md#installation-and-management).
:::

## Configuration

In the below configuration examples, there are two of each plugin configuration element. The first has all configuration elements explicitly configured with the defaults if applicable and the other is the bare minimum using all of the default values. The values enclosed in `<>` are fields that didnâ€™t have default values specified by the plugin. If any of these optional, non-defaulted fields are unspecified, then they will use the Libreswan defaults which can be found [here](https://libreswan.org/man/ipsec.conf.5.html). The values enclosed in `[]` are fields that didn't have default values specified by the plugin and will not be included in the generated 128T configuration.

### Profiles
Profiles are reusable IPsec settings that can be used across multiple nodes in a router and multiple IPsec endpoint `remote`s.

```
router
   ipsec-profile gateway1
       name gateway1
       ike-encryption aes128
       ike-digest sha1
       ike-modp modp1024
       ike-v2 insist
       authentication-protocol esp
       phase2-encryption null
       phase2-digest md5
       phase2-modp modp1024
       ike-lifetime 1h
       connection-lifetime 8h
       ike-retransmit-interval <ike-retransmit-interval>
       compress false
       perfect-forward-secrecy false
       dpddelay <dpddelay>
       dpdtimeout <dpdtimeout>
       dpdaction restart
       local-id <local-id>
       metric <metric>
       mtu <mtu>
       pre-shared-key psk1
   exit
   ipsec-profile gateway2
       name gateway2
       pre-shared-key psk2
   exit
exit
```

:::note
This plugin can only connect to IPsec endpoints that support pre-shared key authentication.
:::

### Clients
Clients are a collection of remote endpoints which can be used for failover purposes.

```
node
    ipsec-client client1
        name client1
        enabled true
        tenant t1
        remote c1gateway1
            name c1gateway1
            host gateway1.com
            profile gateway1
            vector-name [vector-name]
            tenant [tenant]
            subnet <subnet>
            remote-id <remote-id>

        exit
        remote c1gateway2
            name gateway2
            host gateway2.com
            profile gateway2
        exit
    exit
exit
```

:::note
Only one `ipsec-client` can be configured per node, but two `remote`s can be configured per client.
:::

### Generated 128T Configuration
A KNI per remote is created with the name of the `remote` and a single egress KNI is created with the name of the `ipsec-client`.

### User-Specific 128T Configuration
To allow the maximum flexibility on getting the traffic into the plugin's network namespace and getting the traffic out, we rely on the user to configure those means (usually through services and service routes).

You will need to have the IPsec endpoint bound traffic sent into the KNIs with the names of the `remote`s. You can use builtin 128T failover techniques due to the KNIs being reported operationally down when the corresponding tunnel is down. You will also need to configure a way for the traffic to be routed towards the IPsec endpoint after being encrypted. All of this encrypted traffic will be assigned to the `tenant` configured under `ipsec-client`.

### Complete Example Configuration

Below is an example of a complete, but minimal configuration entered by the user.

:::warning
This example configuration is good to understand all of the concepts but should not be used on a system as is.

## Troubleshooting

### Data Model
If the data model doesnâ€™t appear in the PCLI or GUI, make sure that you have restarted the 128T service.

### Logging
The `/var/log/128technology/persistentDataManager.log` file at trace level will hold whether the configuration generation was run as well as output and return code.
The `/var/log/128technology/automatedProvisioner.log` file at trace level will hold whether the pillar generation was run as well as output and return code.
Configuration and pillar generation logs can be found on the conductor under `/var/log/128technology/plugins/ipsec-client-config-generation.log` and `/var/log/128technology/plugins/ipsec-client-pillar-generation.log` respectively.

### Salt
Salt status can be found on the conductor by utilizing the PCLIâ€™s `show assets` and `show assets <asset-id>` commands.

### PCLI Enhancements
To check the status of the IPsec tunnels for a given ingress KNI, extra IPsec tunnel related output will be found in the `show device-interface` command.

Example output for a healthy tunnel:
```

### Systemd Services
To check the status of the IPsec client service on the router, you can run `show system services` which will show all 128T related services running on the specified node. The one for this plugin is named `128t-ipsec`.

To verify that the services are running properly on the 128T router:
* `systemctl status 128t-ipsec@<client>.service`

### Failover Alarms
If a tunnel goes down, we set the corresponding ingress KNI to be operationally down. An alarm will be created when this happens.

Example output when the tunnel for `rem1` goes down:

```admin@combo-west.RTR_WEST_COMBO# show alarms
Tue 2020-06-30 16:42:50 UTC

============== ===================== ========== ============= =========== ==================================

## Release Notes

### Release 3.0.1

#### Issues Fixed

- **PLUGIN-1092** Fix local and remote subnet configuration option to allow a single value or a list of values.

### Release 3.0.0

#### Issues Fixed

- **PLUGIN-768** Support the IPSec client plugin in 128T versions `5.1.0` and greater.
- **PLUGIN-611** Added support for plugin state. Plugin state information can be accessed on the PCLI using `show plugins state [router <router>] [node <node>] [{detail | summmary}] 128T-ipsec-client`

### Release 1.0.6, 2.0.6

#### Issues Fixed

- **PLUGIN-1057** Ensure all critical IPsec client directories are created during installation of the plugin.
- **PLUGIN-1053** Added an inactive IPsec client plugin state to allow seamless migration from zscaler. The inactive state is achieved by excluding `ipsec-client` from the configuration.
- **PLUGIN-1046** Provide IPsec client auto-upgrade capability while crossing the 128T version `4.3.0` boundary.

### Release 1.0.5, 2.0.5

### Release 1.0.4, 2.0.4

#### Issues Fixed

- **PLUGIN-384** Added an MTU configuration option to the ipsec profile.
- **PLUGIN-333** The `plugin-network` ip prefix setting in the configuration was ignored and would instead use the default ip prefix setting.
- **PLUGIN-336** Using the `vector-name` configuration option would generate invalid configuration.
- **PLUGIN-400** Added a local subnet configuration option and enhanced the remote subnet configuration option to allow a list of values.

### Release 1.0.1, 2.0.1

#### Issues Fixed

- **PLUGIN-47** Created generic IPsec client plugin to provide connectivity to remote ipsec endpoints. This version supports a single client with up to two remote endpoints.
