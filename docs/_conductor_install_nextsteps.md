<!---Next Steps - Router Configuration--->

Congratulations, you have successfully installed and configured a conductor! The next step is to optimize the router onboarding process. Creating router configurations on the conductor allows individual routers to download the necessary configuration to get up and running smoothly. 

A sample branch router configuration is available as a [**template**](config_templates.md#default-templates) on the conductor. This is a great place to start the configuration process. Additionally, you can create configuration templates that allow administrators to automate the configuration of top level resources. For more information, see [Configuration Templates](config_templates.md).
