DSCP values may be changed by applications or hardware at any point while traversing a network. In some situations it is important that the DSCP value received at the router is the same as the original value with which it left the client. This feature allows you to preserve the original DSCP value across SVR.

When a new session is created, the DSCP value of the first packet received from the local LAN is recorded and included in the metadata. If DSCP values change within the life of the session, when the packet egresses from SVR the original DSCP value is restored and is used on all subsequent packets. This is different from traditional tunneled solutions where each packet is preserved in its entirety. 

## Configuration

When set to `true` the `preserve-dscp` command allows you to preserve dscp values that have been set in a service class or received on a LAN-Interface, over an SVR path. The default value is false. 
```
authority my-network
  router my-router
    node router-node-1
      device-interface 1
        network-interface 1
          preserve-dscp true
```

## How it Works

In a network with an application or hardware that changes the value on the WAN and a session with a preserved value of 8, the value sent at each of the hops would be as follows:

```
Client (DSCP: 8) -> SSR (DSCP: 8) -> WAN (DSCP: any) -> SSR (DSCP: 8) -> Server
```
The reverse flow will do the same.

```
Server (DSCP: any) -> SSR (DSCP: any) -> WAN (DSCP: any) -> SSR (DSCP: 8) -> Client
```

It is possible to enable this feature alongside `DSCP rewrite`. When these features are combined, the value on the packet at ingress is recorded and included in the metadata as described above. However, when the packet enters the SVR session, it has its DSCP value rewritten based on the SSRâ€™s classification. When the packet egresses SVR, the value is restored to the original recorded value.
To use the example above with `rewrite-dscp` enabled in the forward direction and a classification with a DSCP of 15:

```
Client (DSCP: 8) -> SSR (DSCP: 15) -> WAN (DSCP: any) -> SSR (DSCP:8) -> Server
```
### Handling HA Failover

In a situation where there is an HA failover, the DSCP value from the local LAN is recorded and compared against the previous value. If the values are different and the failover is on the ingress router, the new value is used. If the failover is on the egress router and the values are different, the known value from the ingress router is used.
