SSR software can run on Juniper branded appliances, whitebox hardware (certified or self-evaluated), or virtual environments. For software versions **prior to SSR Version 6.0**, router adoption relies on an on-premise conductor to assist in the onboarding and management. This document explains the process of enabling WAN Assurance telemetry and zero-touch provisioning (ZTP) for **conductor-managed deployments**. This procedure assumes you **do not** already have an account, organization, or sites configured on the Mist portal. These items are required for SSR/Mist WAN Assurance.

For Mist-managed SSR deployments, see the [WAN Assurance Overview for Mist Managed devices.](wan_overview.md)
