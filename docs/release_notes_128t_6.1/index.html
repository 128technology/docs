Several modifications have been made to the process for verifying configurations, which will impact existing configurations.</p></div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-43243/IN-460 Upgrade and Rollback:</strong> Upgrading or rolling back a system (conductor peer or router) with the interactive installer <code>install128t</code>, that is managed by a conductor may result in the system becoming unresponsive. It is recommended that upgrades be performed through the conductor UI. Manual upgrades and rollbacks may not be resilient to failures. See <a href="/docs/intro_rollback">Rolling Back Software</a> for more information on these operations.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-42542 Conductor Upgrade Time:</strong> Upgrades can take up to 40 minutes due to the number of rpms being upgraded. Please plan accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-42624 Upgrade Installer:</strong> Before <strong>upgrading to, or installing</strong> version 5.4 and above, update the Installer to at least version 3.1.0. Failing to upgrade the installer may result in a rollback failure, should a rollback be necessary at any time. The Installer typically prompts you update when a new version is available. Select <strong>Update</strong> when prompted.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plugin Upgrades:</strong> If you are running with plugins, updates are required for some plugins <strong>before</strong> upgrading the conductor to SSR version 5.4.0 or higher. Please review the <a href="/docs/intro_upgrade_considerations#plugin-configuration-generation-changes">Plugin Configuration Generation Changes</a> for additional information.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51007 Conductor only - cpuProperties-core value isolating cores:</strong> <em>In SSR software versions 6.0.0 and greater</em>, the <code>cpuProperties-cores</code> setting in <code>/etc/128technology/local.init</code> is erroneously isolating cores on conductor nodes when set. Because the conductor does not forward packets, there should be no traffic cores allocated to or isolated on the conductor for packet forwarding. This setting was previously ignored on the conductor, but while resolving an earlier issue with the installer and initializer that allocated CPU cores for traffic, that is no longer the case.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is recommended that prior to upgrading the conductor that the user modify local.init to set this setting to <code>0</code>. For example, a setting like this in <code>/etc/128technology/local.init</code>:</p>

<p>Note that only the relevant section of <code>local.init</code> is shown for clarity. All other settings should be left the same.
The change should be made on both nodes of an HA system. If a conductor is already running 6.0.0 or later it will be necessary to <code>systemctl restart 128T</code> on each node after making this change. If the modification is made prior to upgrade it is not necessary to restart 128T service as this will be performed during the upgrade. Making this change on versions earlier than 6.0.0 will not affect operation, and will not require a restart.</p>
<p>This issue will be corrected in an upcoming release.</p>

<li><strong>I95-53641 BGP routes between peers do not immediately transition to the Connected state:</strong> A change has been made to reduce the time that BGP routes learned from a BGP over SVR neighbor are withdrawn when the peer paths are lost to the neighbor.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53787 Stats not present on conductor:</strong> Running <code>show device-interface router all</code> on a conductor caused stats (in-octets, in-unicast-pkts, etc...) to be incorrectly displayed as &quot;n/a&quot; instead of the correct value. This issue has been resolved.</li>

<li><strong>I95-53907 SSR readvertising SA to MSDP mesh peers:</strong> Resolved an issue where MSDP SA&#x27;s received from a mesh-group peer were being re-advertised to the mesh-group. This issue has been resolved by verifying sender of the SA.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53915 Removing an X710/X722 port from SSR can cause high RX latency:</strong> Deleting an SSR interface from an X710/722 NIC which is part of a multi-port device introduces RX latency into sibling ports until the SSR is restarted. This has been resolved by enabling the i40e “multi-driver” mode to preserve global registers that are shared across ports.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53916 Pre-existing Teams interfaces conflict with HA interfaces:</strong> In a Mist-managed HA configuration where an HA node has been configured with non-default HA interfaces, performing a release operation on a node in an HA pair leaves the pre-configured HA interfaces in place, and creates a conflict when a new configuration is pushed down from Mist. This would prevent the HA node from operating correctly and forming its HA connections again. This issue has been resolved, and the release operation now removes any pre-existing HA interfaces.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52316 Enhancements to Overlapping FIB Services:</strong> The <a href="/docs/config_command_guide#configure-authority-fib-service-match"><code>fib-service-match</code></a> command has been added to provide additional control over the creation of FIB entries in combination with routing updates.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><code>best-match-only</code> This is the default value, and legacy behavior. When comparing prefixes from a route update to addresses configured in services, only addresses with the longest prefix match for a particular route are considered. In cases of transport overlap, services are visited in alphabetical order.</li>
<li><code>any-match</code> introduces new behavior. All service addresses that match the route update are considered when creating the FIB entries, including those with prefixes shorter than the update or those that do not have the best match service address. The transports from the service with the longest prefix are considered first. This minimizes missed entries, but may result in a higher FIB usage.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51801 The SSR is unable to see DHCP ACK for the DHCP Request sent by an EX4100:</strong> Added an <code>authoritative</code> field for DHCP servers to enable/disable <code>authoritative</code> mode, which allows the server to send a NAK in response to unknown clients.

</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52968 Configuration template not being applied by the conductor to a router during upgrade:</strong> Resolved an issue where a managed router would silently fail to apply a configuration from a conductor with a greater software version if the configuration contained features that the router&#x27;s earlier SSR version did not understand. Specifically, if a config field such as an enumeration, that the router was aware of, had new values added to it in the conductor&#x27;s version of software then the configuration would not be applied.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52971 Inconsistent hash and signing of RPM files:</strong> Some small number of RPM files did not usen the <code>sha256</code> hash for sigining. This has been corrected and all RPM packages on the distribution ISO are digest sha256 for Common Criteria.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53017 Some files incorrectly marked as executable:</strong> Some cache files were incorrectly marked as executable, and were flagged as part of the Common Criteria validation. These files have been correctly identified and marked.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52426 Incorrect behavior when configuring an IDP custom rule definition:</strong> In a case where a user is modifying a rule to <strong>decrease</strong> the action type to an <code>alert</code>, alerts for that vulnerability will not work. The attack will be allowed to pass through undetected. For example, if the action <code>close-tcp-connection</code> is downgraded to <code>alert</code>, the attacks will pass through undetected.
This issue is actively being addressed, and will be resolved in an upcoming patch release. If you need to use this specific functionality, we recommend creating a custom exception rule specifying the source and destination IP address, along with the vulnerability name, rather than downgrading a vulnerability to an <code>alert</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53124 Sessions destined to private IP address (RFC1918) are incorrectly reported using the application name as the service name:</strong> We have identified an issue where sessions destined to private IP address (RFC1918), are incorrectly reported with the application name as the service name, even if the traffic is HTTP/HTTPS. Session traffic continues to follow the appropriate service / routing profile, but the stats reported may not accurately reflect the learned applications. This is actively being addressed and will be resolved in a future patch.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53878 Dynamic Reconfiguration with LAG/LACP:</strong> Any changes to the LAG configuration require a restart of the 128T service. Configuration changes to the LAG should be performed during a maintenance window, as the changes may disrupt traffic flow.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>I95-466 LAG/LACP Support:</strong> Link Aggregation Groups are formed by connecting multiple ports in parallel between two devices. LACP is the protocol that defines how the group of interfaces operates. Users define the LAG interface and then configure the member device interfaces. This feature is currently in Beta; for more information, a list of supported devices and caveats, see <a href="/docs/config_lacp">Link Aggregation and LACP</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-10141 LLDP Support:</strong> The LLDP mode and parameters allow users to configure the device interface to disable LLDP advertisements, set a <code>receive-only</code> mode, or enable sending and receiving LLDP packets. For information about configuring LLDP, see <a href="/docs/config_reference_guide#lldp"><code>lldp</code></a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-20864 Support for Multicast:</strong> Multicast is a “one source, many destinations” method of traffic distribution. For more information, see <a href="/docs/config_multicast">Multicast</a>. The previous implementation of multicast has been replaced by this new version and is no longer supported. The issue relating to encryption (I95-48792) is addressed in the new implementation.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-44473 Application Steering:</strong> Application Steering provides the ability to configure unique steering policies for individual applications based on the application name, category, application signatures, URLs, and domains. Once the traffic has been classified, it can be steered across the available paths. For more information, see <a href="/docs/config_application_steering">Application Steering</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-49928 BGP over SVR Inter-Hub Steering:</strong> Path based BGP over SVR Routing responds to changes in peer adjacency, operational status, or SLA. It adds the ability to select and advertise BGP routes between BGP over SVR neighbors. It does this by monitoring the peer paths between BGP over SVR peers and dynamically adjusting the BGP neighbor inbound and outbound policy on those peers to reflect the priority and SLA of the peer paths. For more information, see <a href="/docs/config_bgp#bgp-over-svr-inter-hub-steering">BGP over SVR Inter-Hub Steering</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50571/I95-50949/I95-51039 Add packet buffer tracking to help analyze buffer exhaustion:</strong> Packet buffer location tracking has been added, and the following PCLI commands have been created for buffer tracking.<!-- -->

<li>
<p><strong>I95-52426 Incorrect behavior when configuring an IDP custom rule definition:</strong> In a case where a user is modifying a rule to <strong>decrease</strong> the action type, for example, the action <code>close-tcp-connection</code> is downgraded to <code>alert</code>, this may impact other rules, and some attacks may pass through undetected.</p>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> If <code>HTTP:SQL:INJ:HEADER-1</code> is excluded from the ruleset, some other <code>HTTP</code> attacks may pass through undetected. <strong>This behavior only occurs when decreasing the action type in the rule;</strong> i.e.; the action <code>close-tcp-connection</code> is downgraded to <code>alert</code>.</p>
<p>This issue is actively being addressed, and will be resolved in an upcoming patch release. If you need to use this specific functionality, we recommend avoiding this configuration and waiting for the SSR 6.1.5 patch release.</p>

<li><strong>I95-48862 Load balance sessions across BGP RIB Entries with multiple paths:</strong> Resolved an issue when BGP was used to build a routing table, only the first next hop was used. All next hops are now used, and load balancing occurs over all routing protocol routes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50510 New fields for IPFIX:</strong> The SSR IPFIX implementation was not sending the industry standard fields of <code>flowStartMilliseconds</code> and <code>flowEndMilliseconds</code>. In the new implementation, all IPFIX records include these fields. The start time is set to the start time of the flow, and the end time is always set to the time the last packet was received on the flow. For intermediate records, this indicates that the flow is still ongoing but provides the last activity timestamp.

<ul>
<li><code>application-identification</code> is enabled,</li>
<li>a service is defined with <code>domain-name child services</code>, or</li>
<li>a <code>service address</code> is configured as a <code>domain</code>
and there are established flows for any of these services, a link flap triggering a flow invalidation (changes to FIB) will induce a crash in the highway process of the SSR. This issue exists in versions 6.1.0 and 6.1.1, and is resolved in 6.1.2.</li>

<li><strong>I95-50543 systemd unable to start 128T after upgrade:</strong> This issue has been resolved by ensuring that the netfilter kernel is installed.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50710 Configuration cannot be applied to router when its time is ahead of the conductor:</strong> Implemented time detection for configurations using a future time that is corrected upon commit. This resulted in an <code>mtime</code> older than what is in the datastore, and the configurations were rejected.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50736 SSH key change not propogated to secondary conductor:</strong> Resolved an issue where an SSH key change to <code>/etc/128technology/ssh/pdc_ssh_key</code> was not automatically detected and resynced between peer node and conductor nodes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50977 Installer fails to download software when the Conductor software proxy is enabled:</strong> Resolved an issue where when the Conductor software proxy is being used, DNF transactions to the conductor repo go through the proxy, despite the repo pointing to a local tunnel to the conductor. These transactions now go through the proper tunnel.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50979 Routers remain in connected state:</strong> Resolved an issue where assets will perform a new highstate unnecessarily if a commit occurs while a highstate is already in progress, causing assets to take a long time to get to the running state.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51006 Nodes stuck in connected state after upgrade:</strong> On an HA conductor, if the user is performing an upgrade on the first conductor node and that user makes a config commit during the upgrade, then the configuration&#x27;s modified time will become out of sync between the two conductor nodes. When the conductor first node is finished upgrading the result is a loop where the configuration keeps getting committed by each node back and forth until a new commit is made. This issue has been resolved by allowing the peer conductor node to accept the config despite the perceived version disparity. Please note performing a commit mid upgrade is not supported.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51007 Conductor is incorrectly honoring core pinning:</strong> The cpuProperties cores setting in /etc/128technology/local.init was erroneously isolating cores on conductor nodes when set, even though this setting is intended for a router. This would cause a reduction in available processing cores for normal conductor operations. This setting will now be ignored on the conductor.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51021 Package to Image conversion fails on FIPS enabled SSR:</strong> Conversion of <code>package-based</code> to <code>image-based</code> is now supported for systems with FIPS 140-2 mode enabled.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51044 Hide <code>forwarding-core-mode</code> on conductor:</strong> Disabled the <code>forwarding-core-mode</code> setting on conductor nodes, since this setting doesn&#x27;t apply to conductor.</li>

<li>
<p><strong>I95-51087 SSR fails to download firmware after upgrading the conductor:</strong> An issue has been identified where the first time a conductor is upgraded and <strong>conductor-only</strong> is selected in the software-update settings. The proxy service on the conductor does not work correctly, and downloads attempted by the router will fail. This issue will be resolved in the next release.</p>
<p><strong><em>Workaround:</em></strong> Make a simple configuration change and commit the change. Any configuration change is sufficient to start the internal proxy service. Once this commit has been made this will no longer be an issue.</p>
