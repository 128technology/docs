   ```
------

------
- **I95-33989** Incorrect error message reported within PCLI when trying to execute `validate` after a previous _validate_ was terminated with `CTRL+c`

  _**Symptom:**_ The following can be seen in the PCLI output:
  ```
  âœ– Validating...
  % Error: Candidate configuration is invalid:
  1. A request of type validate is already in progress. The first request was started 13 seconds ago
  ```
  Until the system is upgraded to 5.0.0, this issue will resolve itself after the background tasks have completed
