Multicast is a “one source, many destinations” method of traffic distribution, meaning only the destinations that explicitly indicate their need to receive the information from a particular source receive the traffic stream.

Network applications that can function with unicast but are better suited for multicast include collaborative groupware, teleconferencing, periodic or “push” data delivery (stock quotes, sports scores, magazines, newspapers, and advertisements), server or website replication, and distributed interactive simulation (DIS) such as war simulations or virtual reality. Any IP network concerned with reducing network resource overhead for one-to-many or many-to-many data or multimedia applications with multiple receivers benefits from multicast.

Please refer to the [Juniper Multicast Overview](https://www.juniper.net/documentation/us/en/software/junos/multicast/topics/concept/multicast-ip-overview.html) for more in-depth information about Multicast. 

#### Version History

| Release | Modification                |
| ------- | ----------------------------|
| 6.1.0   | This feature was introduced |
| 6.2.0   | Added support for MSDP, SSR as RP |

## Multicast on the SSR 

Multicast on the SSR supports the following protocols and topology: 

- PIM Sparse-Mode
- PIM Source-Specific Multicast (PIM-SSM)
- Static Configuration of RP
- IGMP v2/v3
- Multicast over SVR in Hub and Spoke topology

### Multicast Configuration

:::note
In order to support Multicast over SVR, the BGP over SVR configuration is used in conjunction with the PIM configuration to generate auto-provisioned services and service-paths. BGP over SVR must be provisioned to support the Multicast feature. See [BGP over SVR](config_bgp.md#bgp-over-svr-bgposvr) for configuration details. 
:::

The following are the components necessary to configure multicast over SVR on the SSR. Configuration for each of the components is provided below, and a full example configuration is provided at the end of this process. 

- Routing Interface: Specify the BGP over SVR interface
- BGP over SVR: See [BGP over SVR](config_bgp.md#bgp-over-svr-bgposvr) for configuration details. 
- Routing protocol such as IGMPv2/v3
- PIM
- RP: The Rendezvous Point. In the initial implementation (v6.1.x), the RP must be external to the SSR. This has been revised and the configuration below offers both configurations. 
- Service: Services are created for the multicast traffic, and defined for the Group address.
- Multicast-sender-policy: Defines the tenant that is allowed to be the source of the multicast stream.
- Access Policy: Configures the tenants allowed to receive the multicast traffic via IGMP joins at routers in the network. 

Refer to [Tenants](config_tenants.md) for more information on configuring Tenants.

:::note
Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) is a protocol that allows inter-domain multicast communication. MSDP is only valid for the Any-Source Multicast (ASM) model. If the Source-Specific Multicast (SSM) model is used, MSDP will not send Source-Active (SA) messages to indicate an active source.

### Configuration Process

The following diagram represents a simple multicast configuration. A Client sends a multicast to address 225.1.1.1. Location1 and Location2 want to receive this multicast stream. The network is setup to use an external, non-SSR Rendezvous Point (RP) at 20.20.20.20 for all multicast traffic. This router is 192.168.22.2 and is configured for BGP with SSR rtr2. It advertises 20.20.20.20 as the RP for multicast into BGP,  allowing the SSR network to identify the path to the RP.

Key points in the rtr2 configuration:
* BGP is configured with the external router, 192.168.22.2
* BGP over SVR is configured with two spokes
* PIM is configured on the LAN interface towards the external router
* The tenant `edsel` is configured on the LAN interface

To use `rtr2` as the Rendezvous Point, the existing static RP configuration takes the IP address of the RP. This address should be a routable address configured on `rtr2`. The SSR detects this address as one of its local interfaces and assumes the role of RP. It is recommended to create a routing-interface (unrelated to BGPoSVR configuration) to be a routable address of the local RP. This routing interface must be advertised in the routing protocol. To do this either enable OSPF on the interface, or advertise the address using a BGP network command. For example:

**Create the Routing Interface:**

```
           routing      default-instance
                type    default-instance
                interface       loopback-rp
                    name        loopback-rp
                    ip-address  192.168.128.0
                exit
```
**Advertise the Address using BGP:**

```
               routing-protocol     bgp
                    type            bgp
                    address-family      ipv4-unicast
                        afi-safi        ipv4-unicast
                        network         192.168.128.0/32
                            network-address     192.168.128.0/32
                        exit
                    exit
```

#### Configuration for Spoke 1 (rtr0)

Key points for the Spoke configuration - this applies to each spoke, since the configuration is nearly identical.
* BGP over SVR configured to the hub
* PIM configured with the same RP on the LAN interface
* IGMP configured on the LAN interface
* Using tenant `studebaker` on the LAN where the IGMP joins originate

            exit
        exit
    exit
exit
``` 
#### Configure the Service 

The service allows the traffic to flow. It allows the tenant from the hub `edsel` to send the multicast stream, and the tenants `studebaker` on each spoke can join and receive the multicast stream.   

```
config
    authority
        service  multicast
            name                     multicast
            address                  224.0.0.0/4
            access-policy            studebaker
                source  studebaker
            exit
            multicast-sender-policy  edsel
                source  edsel
            exit
        exit
    exit
exit
```
#### Other Considerations

While this configuration example uses one RP for the multicast range, you can use different RPs for different multicast addresses or ranges. The same can be done for the service; smaller services for more specific ranges of multicast with different senders and receivers as needed.

## Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) 

MSDP is used to allow RPs to share the active Multicast Sources. Messages are sent as Source-Active (SA) messages between MSDP peers. In normal MSDP operation, an MSDP peer is received from one peer and forwarded to the other MSDP peers. To ensure there are no loops, RPF checks have been put in place.

MSDP can also be configured as a `mesh-group`. In this mode, the SA messages received from a peer are not forwarded to the other members of the mesh-group, since all the peers are configured as part of the mesh. This is commonly used with Anycast RPs, where the same RP address is configured on multiple routers in the network. The Anycast RP routers use an MSDP mesh-group to distribute the active source information to the other anycast RPs. This provides redundancy in the network, in case an RP fails.

### Configuration

MSDP can be configured on the router as follows:

```
authority
    router A
        routing default-instance
            msdp
                peer 10.10.10.2 source 16.0.0.2
            exit
        exit
```

Alternatively, MSDP can be configured with a `mesh-group`. A mesh-group is similar to an IBGP peering relationship, in that the received SA messages are not forwarded to other members of the mesh-group.

```
authority
    router A
        routing default-instance
            msdp
                peer 10.10.10.2 source 16.0.0.2
                mesh-group myMesh 
                    source 16.0.0.2
                    member 11.11.11.1
                exit
            exit
        exit
```

MSDP can also be enabled in a VRF:

```
authority
    router A
        routing default-instance
            vrf     vrfA
                msdp
                    peer     10.10.10.2 source 16.0.0.2
                exit
            exit
        exit
```
