#### Version History

| Release | Modification                | 
| ------- | --------------------------- | 
| 7.1.0   | Certificate-based Security Encryption support added. | 

In addition to Enhanced Security Key Management, the SSR offers certificate based security encryption to encrypt, validate, and exchange certificates between devices within the network. The result is a design that creates maximum scale, avoids mid-network re-encryption, and provides the ability to rotate keys as required.

## Certificate Management 

Certificate management allows you to provision a certificate for use with Enhanced Security Key Management. There are four steps to provision a certificate.

1. Instruct the SSR to generate a private key.

2. Instruct the SSR to create and return a CSR using the above key.

3. Send the CSR to the CA and have it issue a certificate.

4. Instruct the SSR to import the certificate.

Before the certificate is accepted, the following three validity checks take place upon importing a certificate:

- Ensure that there is no private key accompanying the certificate.

- Parse the certificate and then validate it (dates/roles/other restrictions, etc.).

- Check the certificate against the known revoked certificates (CRL).

If the above three checks pass, then the certificate is accepted and imported. 

**
Use of the rekey feature requires that a separate certificate, specific to the peering relationship, be used. The peering certificate should be loaded prior to Enhanced Security Key Management being enabled in configuration. 

Certificates are issued to every Juniper manufactured router by the Juniper Networks Certificate Authority. Use of the **Rekey** feature requires that a certificate be provided during installation. The base certificate can be replaced during initial software installation, however all routers in a single authority MUST have certificates issued by the same certificate hierarchy. Otherwise, replacing a certificate may be done during a maintenance window.
**

### Certificate Security

The Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Manager handles the discovery, fetching, and periodic updates to CRLs. From this process a list of all known revoked certificates from all CRL sources is created, and the master list is published to disk.

The following are some details of certificate security.

- The Trusted Platform Module (TPM) stores the private key of the base certificate. The certificate and any keys are not included in any configuration.

- Periodic revocation checks of the base certificate are performed based on the configuration defaults or user configured timelines. 

- When rekeying is enabled on a newly initialized router that does NOT have a valid, signed certificate, an alarm is generated. A valid certificate must be obtained from a Certificate Authority before valid secure communication can take place. When a valid certificate is present, the router will create an elliptic-curve public/private key pair (see [RFC8422]). 

- Contained within the SVR certificate is a router identifier, which must match the identifier of the router in the peer configuration. This router identifier is a UUID and guaranteed to be unique per node, even across RMAs.

- The public key is used to create an X.509 certificate signing request (CSR) with the common name field set to the router's UUID. A certificate signing request is initiated through a secure connection to a configured Certificate Authority (CA). The CA digitally signs the CSR and returns it to the requesting router. Certificates and Public Keys are stored locally on each router in PEM format defined by RFC7468. 

## Certificate Revocation List

Managing the Certificate Revocation List (CRL) includes the discovery, fetching, and periodic updates to CRLs. The SSR can be configured to either dynamically learn revoked and expired certificates and add them to the local CRL, or have the location or locations of the CRL assigned and poll that location at set intervals. The lists of known valid and revoked certificates are gathered and saved locally. The list is then shared with the configured routers.

If the CRL cannot be retrieved, an alarm will fire and persist until such time as that CRL can be retrieved. 

### Configuration

There are two configuration parameters, an optional list of CRL URLs to fetch updates, and the polling interval for those CRL URLs. 

```
configure authority
	certificate-revocation-list <url> 
		polling-interval 24hrs
		backoff-interval 60sec
```

- URL: Enter one or more URLs where CRLs are hosted.
- `polling-interval`: Frequency in hours at which to fetch CRLs. Default is 24.
- `backoff-interval`: Delay in seconds to apply to the polling-interval. Default is 60.

### Peer Certificate 

Peer certificate validation can be configured on a per-router basis as needed. This allows individual routers to check the validity of a peer certificate against the conductor provided CRL, as well as the local in-memory cache of revoked or expired certificates.

```
configure authority router router1
	peer-validation true
```
By default, `peer-validation` is false. 

## Provisioning Process
**can we modify the custom certs prov process for use here? Is it similar?**

Use this procedure to provision a certificate for use with Enhanced Security Key Management.

### Prerequisites

A configured, functioning Certificate Authority (CA) is required.

### Install the Trusted CA Certificate

In order to provision a certificate on the system, install the public certificate of the Certificate Authority, as well as all certificates up the chain to the root of trust. To accomplish this, the user must obtain these certificates and append them into a single file. For example:

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

Once this file has been obtained, the contents are placed into the SSR configuration at the authority level:

```
admin@conductor-east-1.RTR_EAST_CONDUCTOR# config authority
admin@conductor-east-1.RTR_EAST_CONDUCTOR (authority)# trusted-ca-certificate svrv2-root-of-trust
admin@conductor-east-1.RTR_EAST_CONDUCTOR (trusted-ca-certificate[name=svrv2-root-of-trust])# content
Enter plain for content (Press CTRL-D to finish):
<paste the contents here>
admin@conductor-east-1.RTR_EAST_CONDUCTOR (trusted-ca-certificate[name=svrv2-root-of-trust])# validation-mode warn
admin@conductor-east-1.RTR_EAST_CONDUCTOR (trusted-ca-certificate[name=svrv2-root-of-trust])# top
admin@conductor-east-1.RTR_EAST_CONDUCTOR# commit
Are you sure you want to commit the candidate config? [y/N]: y
âš  Validating, then committing...
Configuration committed
```

#### Additional Information

The name of the `trusted-ca-certificate` should be easily identifiable; `svrv2-root-of-trust` was chosen for illustration purposes.

The setting `validation-mode warn` is configured in cases where issues are discovered with the certificate. The certificate chain is committed, but warnings are generated for those issues. If the `validation-mode` is set to `strict` the certificate-chain is not committed.

### Authenticate to Use REST

In order to call into the SSRs REST interfaces, a user must authenticate first. This is accomplished by logging in, and storing the bearer token.

**Example:**

```
curl 'https://10.27.35.89/api/v1/login' --compressed -k -X POST \
  -H 'User-Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10.15; rv:137.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/137.0' \
  -H 'Accept: */*' \
  -H 'Accept-Language: en-US,en;q=0.5' \
  -H 'Accept-Encoding: gzip, deflate, br, zstd' \
  -H 'Referer: https://10.27.35.89/' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -H 'X-Request-Id: MmUzMGMzNj' \
  -H 'Origin: https://10.27.35.89' \
  -H 'Connection: keep-alive' \
  -H 'Sec-Fetch-Dest: empty' \
  -H 'Sec-Fetch-Mode: cors' \
  -H 'Sec-Fetch-Site: same-origin' \
  -H 'Priority: u=0' \
  -H 'TE: trailers' \
  --data-raw '{"username":"admin","password":"TheAdminPassword1234","application":"GUI"}'
```

**Conductor Response:**

```
{"token":"eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJuYW1lIjoiYWRtaW4iLCJyb2xlcyI6WyJhZG1pbiJdLCJzY29wZXMiOlsiY29uZmlndXJlIiwic2hvdy1jb21tYW5kcyJdLCJjYXBhYmlsaXRpZXMiOlsiY29uZml

```

Store the value of the token in a file called `token.txt` for use later.

#### Installing Certificates

Installing a trusted CA certificate on the SSR uses the existing functionality as described in [Adding a Trusted Certificate](howto_trusted_ca_certificate.md).

**COMMENT: I believe the above paragraph is unnecessary if we are using the Provisioning Process, but for this iteration of the feature I need to know which is used** 

## Certificate Replacement or Revocation

When a certificate is revoked, expired, or invalid, the SSR generates an alarm. Based upon the SSR configuration, it will either `fail-soft` (the default behavior) or `fail-hard`.

- `fail-soft` results in a notification that the certificate is no longer valid and that appropriate action must be taken.

- `fail-hard` sends a notification that the certificate is no longer valid, and removes all peering relationships. The peer connection is severed and the device is prevented from participating in SVR.

### Expiring Certificate

Expiring certificates will generate the following alarms.

- Within a month; Minor alarm. 
- Within a week; Major alarm. 
- Currently expired or otherwise invalid; Critical alarm. 

When a router's certificate is about to expire or needs to be replaced, a new certificate can be added to the system using the [installation procedure](howto_trusted_ca_certificate.md). Once the new certificate file has been loaded into the system, an event is triggered to restart the peer authentication procedure.

## High Availability

Each node of an HA pair manages its own unique certificate - certificates are not shared between nodes. Each node manages its own unique connection to its peers.

When two nodes are configured as a redundant pair, each of the keys are exchanged between nodes. This will avoid rekeying on flow migration due to node failures. Keys can be safely exchanged between nodes as the HA sync interfaces are connected point to point over an SSH connection.

## Troubleshooting

Use the following information to help troublshoot certificate events or issues.

### PCLI commands

- `show certificate` - Show basic certificate information
- `show certificate detail` - Show all OpenSSL details about the certificate
