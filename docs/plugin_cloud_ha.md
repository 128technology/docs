title: Cloud High Availability Plugin
sidebar_label: Cloud HA
---

The SSR-cloud-ha plugin provides High Availability (HA) functionality for the SSR Networking Platform deployed in the cloud. HA for SSR routers in a non-cloud environment uses traditional techniques such as VRRP and GARP which both rely on a virtual MAC and virtual IP. In cloud environments such as AWS, Azure, etc., any techniques that rely on broadcast and multicast are not supported. This plugin uses node health metrics sent over SVR, as well as cloud API interactions to perform failovers in these cloud environments.

:::note
The instructions for installing and managing the plugin can be found [here](plugin_intro.md#installation-and-management).

## Supported Solutions

| Solution Name      | `solution-type` | Available In Version |
| ------------------ | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Azure VNET         | `azure-vnet`    | 2.0.0                |
| Azure Loadbalancer | `azure-lb`      | 2.0.0                |
| Alicloud VPC       | `alicloud-vpc`  | 3.0.0                |


## Version Restrictions

 The router component can only be installed on versions of SSR which support provisional state on _device interfaces_. This is necessary for the plugin to be able to prevent asymmetrical routing.
 The versions of SSR that support this feature have a `Provides: 128T-device-interface-api(1.0)`, so it can be checked ahead of time by performing a `rpm -q --whatprovides 128T-device-interface-api(1.0)` to see if the currently installed 128T satisfies this requirement or `dnf list --whatprovides 128T-device-interface-api(1.0)` to see all versions of SSR that satisfy this requirement.


## Plugin Behavior

![architecture](/img/cloud-ha-architecture.png)

### Monitoring Agent

The job of the Monitoring Agent is to produce and transmit health status messages. The Monitoring Agent collects the administrative status, operational status, and mac address of all of the configured redundant interfaces and additional interfaces at one second intervals. The health status is then sent via an HTTP POST to the IP address of the `cloud-ha` interface where the HA Agent is listening on port 12800.

### HA Agent

The job of the HA Agent is to process the health status messages from the the local Monitoring Agent and determine the health status for performing failover operations. For an interface to be healthy, it must be administratively and operationally up. For a node to be healthy, it must have at least one healthy `redundant-interface`. If there are additional interfaces configured, then the node must have at least one healthy `additional-interface`.

The following flow diagram summarizes the process followed by the HA Agent using information supplied by the Monitoring Agent, and resulting in interactions with the API Agent.

![HA Agent Flow Diagram](/img/cloud-ha-ha-agent-flow-diagram.png)

An HA Agent configured with a priority of 1 will be defined as the Primary node; a priority of 2 becomes the Secondary node.

* Primary: This node is preferred to be active except when the local node is unhealthy.
* Secondary: This node is preferred to become active only when the local node is healthy and the remote node is unhealthy or unreachable.

The internal state machines wait for the value set in seconds in `up-holddown-timeout` before considering a node healthy. If at any point during that wait the HA Agent receives an unhealthy status, the timeout will be reset and the node is considered unhealthy.

The internal state machines wait for the `peer-reachability-timeout` after every health status before considering the node unreachable. The timer is reset if a health report is processed before the timeout expires.

When the HA Agent determines that a node must become active, the first active redundant interface's mac address and the list of configured prefixes are sent to the API Agent's appropriate REST endpoint. The HA Agent changes the provisional status of the configured `redundant-interface` to **Up**.

### API Agents

The job of the API Agent is to perform failover actions specific to the cloud provider and the chosen solution.


#### Azure Loadbalancer

A `solution-type` of `azure-lb` can be used to enable the Azure Loadbalancer API agent. This solution requires an [Azure Loadbalancer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/load-balancer/load-balancer-overview) to be configured using an HTTP probe on the `probe-port` with backend pools pointing towards the redundant interfaces.

Probe example:

![Azure Loadblancer Probe Configuration](/img/cloud-ha-azure-lb-probe-config.png)

Backend Pool example:

![Azure Loadblancer Backend Pool Configuration](/img/cloud-ha-azure-lb-backend-pool-config.png)


The Azure Loadbalancer sends a health probe to the redundant SSR's redundant interfaces. These probes are routed through the `cloud-ha` interface, through a `128T-azure-lb-nginx` instance, and down to the Azure Loadbalancer API Agent.

The Azure Loadbalancer API Agent responds to the probes with a `200` status code when the current node is active and a `500` code when its inactive. A probe to the inactive node will not reach the SSR when the redundant interfaces are set provisionally down.

#### Azure VNET

A `solution-type` of `azure-vnet` can be used to enable the Azure VNET API agent. It requires an Azure Route Table setup on the same VNET as the redundant interfaces. The Virtual Machines where these members are running must be granted the following permissions in order for the route updates to work correctly:

* Microsoft.Network/routeTables/read
* Microsoft.Network/networkInterfaces/read
* Microsoft.Network/routeTables/routes/*/write
* Microsoft.Network/routeTables/routes/read
* Microsoft.Compute/virtualMachines/read
* Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read

The agent finds all of the route tables within the VNET using the Azure REST APIs. When a redundant interface becomes active, the agent updates the route tables for all the configured prefixes to point to that interface. The solution is designed to be idempotent, so the peer member's redundant interface will now be inactive. There is no update to the route table needed when becoming inactive.

`Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/read` is only necessary when the plugin should discover and modify peer VNET route tables. This feature can be enabled by configuring `include-peer-vnets` to `true`.

:::warning
To prevent routing loops, the solution will not update the Azure Route Tables assigned to a subnet that has an activating node's _network interface_.
:::

#### Alicloud VPC

A `solution-type` of `alicloud-vpc` can be used to enable the Alicloud VPC API agent. It requires an Alicloud Route Table setup on the same VNET as the redundant interfaces.

Since the deployment of Juniper SDWAN HA requires granting RAM role permissions, you need to add a RAM username for this under your current Alicloud account and grant the following permissions. The Virtual Machines where these members are running must be granted with the RAM role with following permissions in order for the route updates to work correctly:

* AliyunECSFullAccess
* AliyunVPCFullAccess

The agent finds all of the route tables within the Alicloud VPC using the Alicloud REST APIs. When a redundant interface becomes active, the agent updates the route tables for all the configured prefixes to point to that interface. The solution is designed to be idempotent, so the peer member's redundant interface will now be inactive. There is no update to the route table needed when becoming inactive.

:::warning
To prevent routing loops, the solution will not update the Alicloud Route Tables assigned to a subnet that has an activating node's _network interface_.

## Scenarios

### Both Healthy

In the case where both members are healthy, the primary node is preferred and set to active. The secondary node is inactive. The redundant interface on the secondary node is set provisionally down and the API Agent steers traffic towards the primary node.

![both-healthy-scenario](/img/cloud-ha-both-healthy-scenario.png)

### Primary Failure

When the **primary node** becomes unhealthy and the redundant interfaces are operationally down, the Monitoring Agent sends an unhealthy status to the local HA Agent. When the **local node** is deemed unhealthy, the local HA Agent sends an unhealthy message to the remote HA Agent, and notifies the internal state machine. When the **primary node** recognizes it is no longer fit to process traffic, it becomes inactive. The **secondary node** recognizes the primary node is not processing traffic, and the **secondary node** is healthy so the secondary node becomes active.

![primary-failure-scenario](/img/cloud-ha-primary-failure-scenario.png)

### Primary Recovery

Now something causes the primary node to recover and the `redundant-interface` becomes healthy again. The healthy statuses will propagate to the primary and secondary HA Agents and they will update their internal state machines which will determine that they are back to the Both Healthy Scenario. The primary node will become active and the secondary node will become inactive.

![both-healthy-scenario](/img/cloud-ha-both-healthy-scenario.png)

### Secondary Failure

Now let us consider after recovering, the secondary node becomes unhealthy. The primary node will recognize that it is still healthy so it will not do anything and continue to process traffic. The secondary node will also realize that it is unfit to process traffic so it will also not do anything and continue sit idle.

![secondary-failure-scenario](/img/cloud-ha-secondary-failure-scenario.png)

### Secondary Recovery

If the problem with the secondary node resolves, then the HA Agents will update their internal state, but again since traffic is preferred to flow the same as before, both the primary and secondary will not perform any API calls to the API Agents.

![secondary-recovery-scenario](/img/cloud-ha-secondary-recovery-scenario.png)

### Primary Shutdown

This scenario is what will occur if the primary node were to be taken down for maintenance or failed completely. The primary node's HA Agent (and Monitoring Agent and API Agent) will be shutdown when SSR is shutdown, so it will not perform any failover operations. The secondary node will wait for `peer-reachability-timeout` seconds of not hearing from the primary node to determine that the secondary node is unreachable. Once the primary node is determined unreachable, the secondary HA Agent will take over and become active since it does not know if the primary node is shutdown or unreachable.

![primary-shutdown-scenario](/img/cloud-ha-primary-shutdown-scenario.png)

### Secondary Shutdown

If the secondary node is shutdown while the primary is healthy, the primary HA Agent will deteremine the secondary node unreachable. Similar to the the Secondary Failure scenario, since the primary node is preferred, it will not do anything and continue to process traffic.

![secondary-shutdown-scenario](/img/cloud-ha-secondary-shutdown-scenario.png)

### Split Brain

This is slightly distinct from the Primary Shutdown or Secondary Shutdown because both nodes and HA Agents are up and running, but the peer link between the nodes is down. In this case, both HA Agents determine that the other HA Agent is unreachable. This is indistinguisable from the other node being shutdown, so both HA Agents will determine they are in the position to take control of traffic, so whichever node was not already active will become active. This means that both nodes will have their `redundant-interface`s provisionally up. For the `azure-vnet` solution, there will still only be one node that the route tables are pointing their routes towards due to the nature of the solution. For the `azure-lb` solution, both nodes will respond to the probes so traffic will be split according to the Azure Loadbalancer configuration. This situation can cause asymmetrical routing where if branch traffic comes in on the node that the solution is not pointed towards, then traffic will be sent into Azure through that node and come back in through the other node.

The split brain scenario can be identified if the peers can't reach each other which will be captured with alarms:
```
# show alarms

========================= ===================== ========== ======== =========== =======================================
 ID                        Time                  Severity   Source   Category    Message
========================= ===================== ========== ======== =========== =======================================
 router.node:11            2020-12-16 05:40:40   CRITICAL   router2    PEER      Peer router2 is not reachable
 router2.node2:10          2020-12-16 05:40:42   CRITICAL   router     PEER      Peer router is not reachable

```

Another indicator of a split brain scenario is having the `remote-status` be `unreachable` for the [state output](#state-fields) for both members.

![split-brain-scenario](/img/cloud-ha-split-brain-scenario.png)

### Split Brain Resolution

Once the health statuses are able to flow between the two nodes, the unreachable status that each Cloud HA Agent has for the other node will resolve to healthy or unhealthy. Even if the determination of whether the node is the same as it was before, each HA Agent will still set the provisional statuses and make the appropriate HTTP call on API Agent. This is because each node does not know what calls the other node made while the split brain was occurring, so it is safer to make calls even if it may not be necessary. Consider the scenario where the primary node is active and the secondary node is inactive before a split brain. When the split brain occurs, the secondary will then become active. If this is with a solution like `azure-vnet`, the last node to hit the API Agent will be the one that the solution point to. Thus the secondary node will be the active node from the Azure Route Table's perspective. Once the split brain is resolved, without the extra API calls, the primary would stay active without making any API calls and the secondary would become inactive. The problem with this is that the last node to trigger the API Agent was the secondary node so all branch bound traffic would be sent into interfaces that are provisionally down. The plugin solves this by reperforming API calls when it detects that the remote node goes from unreachable to not unreachable.

## Configuration

### Groups
A group is a collection of nodes which all share the same settings such as the solution type. In the below configuration snippet, there is an example of each of the supported solution types with the solution-specific configuration explicitly configured with their defaults. `group1` has all of the solution-agnostic configuration settings explicitly configured with their defaults.

```
authority
    cloud-redundandy-group group1
        name group1
        enabled true
        solution-type azure-lb
        additional-branch-prefix 1.1.1.1/32
        additional-branch-prefix 2.2.2.2/24
        up-holddown-timeout 2
        peer-reachability-timeout 10
        remote-health-network 169.254.180.0/24
        health-interval 2
    exit
    cloud-redundandy-group group2
        name group2
        solution-type azure-vnet
        include-peer-vnets false
    exit
exit
```

### Membership

Membership is how a node declares that it is part of a group. The configuration for a membership exists under the node and is where the node-specific configuration exists.

```
node
    cloud-redundancy-plugin-network 169.254.137.0/30

    cloud-redundancy-membership group1
        cloud-redundancy-group group1
        priority 1
        redundant-interface private
        redundant-interface private2
        additional-interface public1
        additional-interface public2
        log-level
            ha-agent info
            api-agent info
        exit
    exit
exit

:::note
Nodes can only be members of one group.
:::

### Address Prefixes

Certain prefixes can be configured to be controlled by the Cloud HA SSR by tagging services with groups. The services that are tagged with a certain group will have all of their `address` fields added to the list of configured prefixes.

```
service
    address 3.3.3.3
    address 4.4.4.4/24
    cloud-redundancy-group group1
    cloud-redundancy-group azure-vnet
exit
```

Any additional prefixes that should be included in the controlled prefix list can be configured as `additional-branch-prefix`s under the group.

## Generated SSR Configuration

To see a full blown configuration and the configuration it generates, look at `Complete Example Configuration` in the `Appendix`.

### Validation

The following criteria need to be met in order for the cloud-ha plugin to take effect for a specific group:

* Priorities across all members in a group are unique.
* IP Network fields such as `remote-health-network` and `cloud-redundancy-plugin-network` are validated to be an acceptable prefix size.
* The `peer-reachability-timeout` for a group must be at least twice the amount of time as the `health-interval`.

Please check `/var/log/128technology/plugins/cloud-ha-config-generation.log` on the Conductor for the errors causing the config to be invalid.

### Configuration Assumptions

The components that are assumed to be setup already:

* There is at least one functioning forwarding _device interface_ on each of the member nodes.
* There is peering between member nodes if the member nodes are not under the same router.


### Cloud HA Loopback Interface

An interface with the name `cloud-ha` is generated for each node that is a member of an enabled group. This interface is used for the solution to communicate with the other group members and any other outside entities such as a load balancer.

### Health Status Transport

To facilitate the transport of the health status between members of the same group, the plugin generates services and service routes. Services are generated to classify the health summaries that each member sends to its peers. The address that they use is an address from the network defined in `remote-health-network` under the group config. If the two nodes are under different routers in the configuration, then peer service routes will be generated.

### Azure Load Balancer Config Generation

If the `solution-type` of a group is `azure-lb`, then the plugin will generate services and service routes to route the http probes down into the `cloud-ha` interface for the Azure Load Balancer API Agent to respond to.


## Troubleshooting

### Configuration Generation
The `/var/log/128technology/persistentDataManager.log` file at trace level will hold whether the configuration generation was run as well as output and return code.
Configuration generation logs can be found on the conductor under `/var/log/128technology/plugins/cloud-ha-config-generation.log`.

Additional configuration validation is done without causing a traditional validation error. These validation rules will cause the configuration generation to fail for just that group. If the configuration generation is not generating what is expected, then check `/var/log/128technology/plugins/cloud-ha-config-generation.log` for validation errors similar to these:

```
2020-10-09 19:54:21,190: ERROR - Validation errors occurred:
Group group1 does not have unique priorities across members: {'node2 router2': '2', 'node1 router1': '2'}
```


### Logging
The different services on the router all log to the files captured by the glob `/var/log/128technology/plugins/cloud-ha-*.log`


### PCLI Enhancements
To check the state of the Cloud HA solution running on the router, the plugin adds output to the  `show device-interface` command for the `cloud-ha` interface. This state information is also accessible from the SSR's public REST API with a `GET` on `/api/v1/router/<router>/node/<node>/cloud-ha/state`.

### Systemd Services

* `128T-telegraf@cloud_ha_health`: the instance of the monitoring agent that produces the health statuses
* `128T-cloud-ha`: the decision making Cloud HA Agent
* `128T-azure-lb` and `128T-azure-lb-nginx`: the `azure-lb` specific services
* `128T-azure-api`: the `azure-vnet` specific service

### Manual Failover

This should only be done in an emergency, but if the plugin is not behaving as expected, there is a script to manually set the activity status of the nodes. First you need to disable the HA Agents by running `/usr/bin/t128_cloud_ha_controller disable` on both nodes. This step disables the automatic API calls of the HA Agent to ensure that the following manual changes will not be overridden. Then you can run `/usr/bin/t128_cloud_ha_controller become-active` to become active and `/usr/bin/t128_cloud_ha_controller become-inactive` to become inactive. The commands should be done together at the most similar time as possible to minimize convergence time. It is better to perform the `become-active` first to allow traffic and then `become-inactive` second to disallow traffic. The HA Agents can be re-enabled with the command `/usr/bin/t128_cloud_ha_controller enable`.


### Alarms
If the Cloud HA Agent does not come up cleanly or fails for a prolonged period of time, the `cloud-ha` interface will become operationally down. An alarm will be created when this happens.

Example output when the agent did not come up cleanly:

```admin@combo-west.RTR_WEST_COMBO# show alarms
Tue 2020-10-09 16:42:50 UTC

============== ===================== ========== ============= =========== ======================================

There are 0 shelved alarms
Completed in 0.10 seconds
```

### Router Version Incompatibility

As mentioned in the `Version Restrictions` section, the router component of the plugin will only install on SSR versions which support the provisional device interface state. This will be apparent to the user if the router component is not being setup and `show assets` indicates an error similar to:

```
Error:
    Problem: conflicting requests
    - nothing provides 128T-device-interface-api(1.0) needed by 128T-cloud-ha-router-1.1.0-1.x86_64
```

The router will need to be upgraded to a compatible version. Compatible versions can be listed with  `dnf list --whatprovides 128T-device-interface-api(1.0)`.


## Appendix

### Health Status Transport

With the example configuration, we will generate the services below:

```
service                 cloud-ha-service-group1-2
    name                  cloud-ha-service-group1-2

    applies-to            router
        type         router
        router-name  router1
        router-name  router2
    exit
    security              internal
    address               169.254.180.2

    access-policy         cloud-ha
        source      cloud-ha
        permission  allow
    exit
    share-service-routes  false
exit

service                 cloud-ha-service-group1-1
    name                  cloud-ha-service-group1-1

    applies-to            router
        type         router
        router-name  router1
        router-name  router2
    exit
    security              internal
    address               169.254.180.1

    access-policy         cloud-ha
        source      cloud-ha
        permission  allow
    exit
    share-service-routes  false
exit

```

Corresponding service routes to route them into the `cloud-ha` interface will be generated.

```
router router1
    service-route        cloud-ha-service-route-group1-1
        name          cloud-ha-service-route-group1-1
        service-name  cloud-ha-service-group1-1
        nat-target    169.254.137.2
    exit
exit

router router2
    service-route        cloud-ha-service-route-group1-2
        name          cloud-ha-service-route-group1-2
        service-name  cloud-ha-service-group1-2
        nat-target    169.254.137.2
    exit
exit
```

If the two nodes are under different routers in the configuration, this would produce service routes:

```
router router1
    service-route        cloud-ha-peer-service-route-group1-2
        name          cloud-ha-peer-service-route-group1-2
        service-name  cloud-ha-service-group1-2
        peer          router2
    exit
exit

router router2
    service-route        cloud-ha-peer-service-route-group1-1
        name          cloud-ha-peer-service-route-group1-1
        service-name  cloud-ha-service-group1-1
        peer          router1
    exit
exit
```

### Azure Loadbalancer Configuration Generation

With the example configuration, this would result in the following services being generated:

```
service                 cloud-ha-lb-probe-service-group1-2
    name                  cloud-ha-lb-probe-service-group1-2

    applies-to            router
        type         router
        router-name  router2
    exit
    security              internal

    transport             tcp
        protocol    tcp

        port-range  12801
            start-port  12801
        exit
    exit
    address               1.1.1.2

    access-policy         private
        source      private
        permission  allow
    exit
    share-service-routes  false
exit

service                 cloud-ha-lb-probe-service-group1-1
    name                  cloud-ha-lb-probe-service-group1-1

    applies-to            router
        type         router
        router-name  router1
    exit
    security              internal

    transport             tcp
        protocol    tcp

        port-range  12801
            start-port  12801
        exit
    exit
    address               1.1.1.1

    access-policy         private
        source      private
        permission  allow
    exit
    share-service-routes  false
exit
```

There would also be corresponding service routes generated:

```
router router1
    service-route        cloud-ha-lb-probe-service-route-group1-1
        name          cloud-ha-lb-probe-service-route-group1-1
        service-name  cloud-ha-lb-probe-service-group1-1
        nat-target    169.254.137.2
    exit
exit

router router2
    service-route        cloud-ha-lb-probe-service-route-group1-2
        name          cloud-ha-lb-probe-service-route-group1-2
        service-name  cloud-ha-lb-probe-service-group1-2
        nat-target    169.254.137.2
    exit
exit
```

### Complete Example Configuration #1 for azure-lb

Below is an example of a complete, but minimal configuration entered by the user.
