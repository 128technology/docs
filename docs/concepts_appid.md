## Identifying Applications by Name

The 128T Session Smart routing platform has several techniques by which it can associate inbound traffic to named applications. This is sometimes referred to as "Application Identification" (or "appID"), and the feature that allows administrators to define network policies using Fully Qualified Domain Names (FQDNs) instead of IP addresses.

The 128T router has three built-in techniques for affiliating named applications to services, all of which will be described in this document. (A fourth technique, involving service function chaining third party software is not covered here.) The three techniques are:

1. Using DNS to resolve FQDNs to IP addresses
2. Using the `application-identification` mode `tls`
3. Using the `application-identification` mode `module`

### DNS-based Services

Generally, when configuring a `service` on a 128T router, administrators use the `address` field to identify the IP address(es)/CIDR block(s) that the 128T should use to match to inbound traffic. However, the `address` field will also accept hostnames, such as `www.128technology.com`. When a service uses a hostname in the `address` field, it is referred to as a *DNS-based service*.

For every DNS-based service, the 128T will use its local DNS to resolve the hostnames; for every IP address that is returned the 128T will treat that as though it were configured in the `address` field, and install FIB entries accordingly. It will also refresh these FIB entries based on the time-to-live (TTL) returned by the DNS server. Here is a sample configuration for reference:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show config running authority service interchange

config

    authority

        service  interchange
            name                  interchange

            scope                 private
            security              internal
            address               community.128technology.com

            access-policy         trusted
                source      trusted
                permission  allow
            exit
            share-service-routes  false
        exit
    exit
exit
```

In this configuration, the `address` is configured as `community.128technology.com`. This will be resolved once the configuration is committed, and the 128T will resolve that hostname and install FIB entries. The 128T will periodically re-resolve those hostnames to ensure that the FIB entries are kept up-to-date.

:::note
The names used in the `address` field must be DNS-resolvable names. You cannot use wildcards such as `*.128technology.com`.
:::

**Advantages**:

1. This is a very easy and intuitive way to associate traffic to services, without having to define a long list of IP addresses. When upstream devices change their IP address, there's no need to reconfigure the 128T to keep it up-to-date, as this is handled by DNS.
2. Unlike AppID based on TLS, there is no "chicken and egg issue;" i.e., no prerequisite to have the destination be reachable in order to learn the destination's name.

**Disadvangates**:

This technique relies on your 128T getting the same answers from DNS that your clients get. Take for example a massive SaaS provider such as `www.salesforce.com`. Their web site resolves to hundreds or thousands of IP addresses distributed across the globe. When the 128T resolves that hostname, it will get a handful of answers; if a client does the same DNS query and gets a different set of answers, then the traffic the client sends will not match the FIB entries that the 128T has created.

:::tip Key to success
Use DNS-based services when your destination uses a small set of nonvolatile IP addresses. This technique is perfect for small, hosted services. The effectiveness of using DNS-based services diminishes rapidly when referencing names that resolve to dozens of address or more.
:::

### AppID based on TLS

The 128T router can also *learn about named destinations* by inspecting the traffic that traverses it. This is done by inspecting the X.509 certificate sent by a server during the TLS handshake process. Importantly: *this presupposes that the 128T can route packets to that destination for the purposes of retrieving the server's certificate*. Thus, when using AppID based on TLS, it is important to ensure that there is a `service` and `service-route` capable of reaching that server in addition to the one you'll configure for the named application.

:::note
Normally this is done by having a "catch-all" service for `0.0.0.0/0` to route traffic out to the internet, but it does not need to be.
:::

Within the `Server Hello` message sent by a server will include its X.509 certificate, which is decipherable by the client to include information about the server. One such example is here:

```
[ptimmons@labsystem1 ~]$ openssl x509 -in /tmp/512b-rsa-example-cert.pem -text -noout

         16:40
```

:::note
This sample certificate was supplied by [FM4DD](http://www.fm4dd.com/openssl/certexamples.htm).
:::

About a third of the way through the output you can see that the *Common Name* (listed as `CN` in the `Subject` line) is `www.example.com`. This is what 128T will parse and subsequently retain as the "application name" for this destination. Assuming this matches a configured `application-name` within a `service`, a FIB entry is installed with this server's IP address and associated with the `service`.

To enable application identification based on TLS, configure the `application-identification` element within the `router` context as seen here:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show config running authority router burlington application-identification

config

    authority

        router  burlington
            name                        burlington

            application-identification
                mode  tls
            exit
        exit
    exit
exit
```

For reference, here's a `service` that would leverage the X.509 certificate shown above:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show config running authority service example

config

    authority

        service  example
            name                  example
            description           "www.example.com website"
            application-name      www.example.com

            access-policy         trusted
                source      trusted
                permission  allow
            exit
            service-policy        NO-LTE
            share-service-routes  false
        exit
    exit
exit
```

Here we can see the `application-name` set to `www.example.com`, which matches the Common Name from the X.509 certificate in our example. Assuming we had a `service`/`service-route` capable of reaching `www.example.com` to begin with, the TLS handshake would see the server's X.509 certificate returned back to the client through the 128T. The 128T parses the certificate, recognizes `www.example.com` as belonging to the service named `example` and installs a FIB entry for it with the server's IP address.

:::note
The `example` service needs to have its own `service-route` in order for traffic to be forwarded.
:::

With the TLS-based application identification technique, the `application-name` can include a wildcard such as `*.example.com`, which is not possible with the DNS-based approach. This gives administrators a bit more flexibility in defining which traffic to match to services when parsing the X.509 certificates.

### AppID using Modules

The last, and arguably most powerful built-in technique for performing application identification is to use a *module* â€“ effectively, a script that is resident on the 128T router's host operating system that will generate a JSON file that contains dynamic, ingestible routes. This is extremely flexible, but requires some programming expertise.

:::note
It is also possible to simply place a static JSON document on the 128T's filesystem (i.e., one that is not generated by a local script) as a means of feeding an application identification module into the 128T).
:::

Configuring application identification based on modules first requires that a router have the feature enabled:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show config running authority router becket application-identification

config

    authority

        router  becket
            name    becket

            application-identification
                mode  module
            exit
        exit
    exit
exit
```

#### Script-Based Module Setup

Scripts are placed on the router's filesystem at `/etc/128technology/application-modules/`. These scripts produce a JSON output stored at `/var/run/128technology/application-modules/`, which in turn is consumed by the 128T router and installed as FIB entries.

#### Systemd-Based Module Setup

Beginning with the 5.2 release, `systemd` may be used to manage the execution of application identification modules. JSON output is posted to highway via a REST API instead of being written to disk.

Using this approach, modules are registered by creating a file at `/etc/128technology/application-modules/services/<module-name>`. This file lists the systemd units of the module and specifies if and how 128T should interact with them.
- `reload-service`: When the highway process starts, reload the systemd unit. This is a signal to POST the JSON to highway again as module data is not saved through process restarts.
- `stop-on-shutdown`: Stop the systemd unit when 128T is shutting down.

Modules must be registered in order for 128T to accept the POST of JSON module data.

In the following example, a systemd timer unit is used to periodically invoke the main service/script, which does the work of gathering module data. Both are stopped on shutdown, but only the timer unit needs to fire again on restart of 128T.
```
[
    {
        "service-name": "office365.timer",
        "reload-service": true,
        "stop-on-shutdown": true
    },
    {
        "service-name": "office365.service",
        "reload-service": false,
        "stop-on-shutdown": true
    }
]
```

#### Viewing Modules

Beginning with the 5.2 release, module registration and detailed module status (including a full list of ip-prefix/ports/protocol) can be accessed via a REST API or from the CLI. Please refer to the API documentation available from the GUI, and the [`show application modules status`](cli_reference.md/#show-application-modules-status) and [`show application modules registration`](cli_reference.md/#show-application-modules-registration) for full details.

#### Referencing Modules in Configuration

Each module produces a list of service names that are used to reference it in the configuration through the `application-name` list. For example, an application identification module named `zoom` will retrieve and process all of the IP addresses used for the `ZOOM` videoconferencing service. The corresponding service looks like this:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show config running authority service ZOOM

config

    authority

        service  ZOOM
            name                  ZOOM

            description           "Zoom meetings"
            scope                 private
            application-name      ZOOM

            access-policy         trusted
                source      trusted
                permission  allow
            exit
            share-service-routes  false
        exit
    exit
exit
```

The `application-name` is configured as it is with the `tls` variant of `application-identification`. In this case, however, it will read the contents of a JSON file to produce the FIB entries. Below is an excerpt from the `zoom` module's output:

```
{
  "duration": 86400,
  "services": {
    "ZOOM": [
      {
        "ip-prefix": "3.7.35.0/25"
      },
      {
        "ip-prefix": "3.21.137.128/25"
      },
      {
        "ip-prefix": "3.22.11.0/24"
      },
      ...
    ]
  },
  "module-name": "zoom"
}
```

:::note
In the case of this module, the script that generates the JSON is `/etc/128technology/application-modules/zoom.py`, the output is stored as `/var/run/128technology/application-modules/zoom.json`. A copy of the `zoom.py` script is available on our user community, [Interchange](https://community.128technology.com).
:::

The `services` tag of `ZOOM` is what associates these IP prefixes to the service we've shown above. Each of these IP prefixes (which could have also included port ranges, but don't in this example) will create a FIB entry for the `ZOOM` service, and be given access and policy determinations based on the configuration we've set in our 128T.

The 128T product ships with an Office365 module, and other modules can be found on [Interchange](https://community.128technology.com), our user community, as well as on Github.
