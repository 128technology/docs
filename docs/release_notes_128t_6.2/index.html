Several modifications have been made to the process for verifying configurations, which will impact existing configurations.</p></div></div>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-43243/IN-460 Upgrade and Rollback:</strong> Upgrading or rolling back a system (conductor peer or router) with the interactive installer <code>install128t</code>, that is managed by a conductor may result in the system becoming unresponsive. It is recommended that upgrades be performed through the conductor UI. Manual upgrades and rollbacks may not be resilient to failures. See <a href="/docs/intro_rollback">Rolling Back Software</a> for more information on these operations.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-42542 Conductor Upgrade Time:</strong> Upgrades can take up to 40 minutes due to the number of rpms being upgraded. Please plan accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-42624 Upgrade Installer:</strong> Before <strong>upgrading to, or installing</strong> version 5.4 and above, update the Installer to at least version 3.1.0. Failing to upgrade the installer may result in a rollback failure, should a rollback be necessary at any time. The Installer typically prompts you update when a new version is available. Select <strong>Update</strong> when prompted.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>Plugin Upgrades:</strong> If you are running with plugins, updates are required for some plugins <strong>before</strong> upgrading the conductor to SSR version 5.4.0 or higher. Please review the <a href="/docs/intro_upgrade_considerations#plugin-configuration-generation-changes">Plugin Configuration Generation Changes</a> for additional information.</li>

</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50697 RFC1918 sessions (private IP addresses) are reclassified in error:</strong> When a session destined for a private IP (RFC1918) experiences an App-ID modify, the session will now only be reclassified if the classification data reflects a positive classification change.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51663 TCP port reuse causing session issues in session timeout management:</strong> Resolved an issue where TCP client port reused caused backwards state transitions in TCP state tracking.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51787 SNMP alarms generation is not FIPS compliant:</strong> SNMP now uses the SHA1 algorithm to identify a specific instance of an alarm. After upgrading to this release, you will see different values for these instance IDs. These values are defined as &quot;opaque&quot; and are not guaranteed to be consistent from release to release.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52250 Security Package Update:</strong>  Intrusion Detection and Prevention (IDP) signatures have been updated.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52500 SVR multi-hop failover causes traffic to drop when using outbound-only:</strong> Added a session lookup by session-ID to resolve a situation where sessions failing between multi-hop SVR and direct SVR connections may lead to duplicate flow exceptions and dropped traffic.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53216 Unable to change password for users managed through external user databases (such as LDAP or RADIUS):</strong> Resolved an issue that caused a &quot;Password Change&quot; dialog to appear for remotely authenticated users.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53523 LAG interface unbind errors following shutdown of the 128T service:</strong> The order in which a LAG interface is broken down and cleaned up after shutdown has been optimized and errors resolved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53565 Port state of LAG members not dynamically updated:</strong> Resolved an issue where enabling or disabling a bond member port does not update the status until the 128T service is restarted. The adminisrative enable and disable now works as expected.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53920 Password expiration incorrectly applied to users managed through external user databases (such as LDAP or RADIUS):</strong> Resolved an issue that incorrectly enforced password expiration (<code>configure authority password-policy lifetime</code>) to RADIUS users.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54127 Users managed through external user databases (such as LDAP or RADIUS) cannot generate or view TSI:</strong> Resolved an issue that did not provide a home directory for custom roles, which prevented LDAP users from viewing the systemd journal.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54189 Application classification mapping does not correctly match configured services:</strong> Resolved an issue where DPI was misclassifying sessions due to IP overlap. When services use an IP address with different ports assigned to different services, the SSR now recognizes these different port configurations.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54271 Race condition after a configuration change related to the source NAT:</strong> Resolved a rare condition where the NAT pool was being reset while it was accessed for session setup. This caused a race condition that led to a highway process crash.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54340 Hub-to-spoke sessions fail during failover from outbound-only path:</strong> When a session modify occurs due to an ingress change (inter-node -&gt; inter-router) AND an egress change is also detected, the incorrect security was looked up for the old flow, causing an exception to be thrown and the modify to fail. This would present itself as dropped packets and in logs as a SecurityNotFound error. This issue has been resolved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54440 / I95-50787 Rebooting the OS from the conductor throws error code 400:</strong> Resolved an issue in the GUI with the reboot button on the Router page. When trying to reboot a router, the button would fail and display <strong>Error: EOF</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54471 LAN-to-LAN traffic with Destination NAT without a gateway configured for either subnet results in dropped traffic and the error log: <code>ServiceAreaGatewayLookupFailed</code> exceptions:</strong> When the egress interface has no gateway, the original packet dest IP was used for gateway lookup. Oftentimes, the original packet dest IP is off-subnet, but the matching <code>bidirectional-nat local-ip</code> is in-subnet. Applying dest NAT first and then looking up the gateway can avoid the <code>ServiceAreaGatewayLookupFailed</code> exception.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54512 Forming an HA cluster with an SSR 130 does not come up properly:</strong> Resolved an issue where the generation of an improper configuration could lead to a crash loop in the NodeMonitor process.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54726 Duplicate service-routes for IDP being created, resulting in a <code>nodeMonitor</code> crash:</strong> Resolved an issue where duplicate routes were being created in <code>hub</code> mode because the service-name field was being used rather than the name field. This issue has been corrected.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54750 Load Balancer API Calls not working:</strong> The original API and Swagger documentation used <code>Load Balancer</code>, which was misleading. The <code>Reachability Detection</code> REST APIs have been updated to use <code>Reachability Detection</code> as reference, instead of <code>Load Balancer</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54780 Forwarding CPU utilization metrics missing for duration greater than 1 hour:</strong> Updated the retention policy for forwarding CPU utilization and other metrics.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54803 Control packets are treated with equal priority in overload conditions, causing drops:</strong> Control packets now have preferential treatment, reducing the drop rate.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54808 Ingress VLAN tag getting stripped for vSSR with SR-IOV:</strong> Added measures to prevent the vlan reinsert flag from being reset.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54833 HA port is showing as redundant:</strong> Resolved an issue where adding a device-interface back into the configuration after it was removed did not recreate the device-state.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54841 No service paths available on RP after all receivers leave the stream:</strong> The PIM Register State would time out at the RP due to the First-Hop router (FHR) not correctly processing the PIM Packets to send the PIM Registers. The FHR now send the PIM Registers periodically to prevent the state from timing out.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54867 SSR-1300 baud rate set incorrectly:</strong> Resolved an issue where the incorrect baud rate was allowed. The only allowed baud rate for the SSR is now 115200. This is the default rate.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54901 During source specific multicast, the FHR is displaying the Register Flag (F):</strong> The display was incorrectly showing the register flag (F); PIM registers are not sent for SSM groups, so this flag should not be sent. The display issue causing this has been resolved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54909 Alarm not generated when Websense is down</strong> Implemented an alarm when the connection to the Websense server is down or responds with a 5xx error.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54927 Receiver can join stream without any tenant assigned to interface:</strong> This issue has been resolved by creating multicast boundaries in the routing engine to block all multicast addresses on interfaces that do not match the multicast service access-policy.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55002 Password reset loop:</strong> Resolved an issue that caused users created with the <strong>Require password change on first login?</strong> set to <code>yes</code> to get stuck in an infinite loop of password changes when logging in using the GUI.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55060 PIM register messages don&#x27;t need a tenant assigned to be sent over SVR:</strong> This could potentially be disruptive to multicast services. PIM RP and LAN services have been made private.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55067 Unable to select specific Mist Cloud instance during onboarding:</strong> This functionality has been added to the CLI using the <code>mist-instance</code> argument under the <code>adopt</code> command, and in the GUI when onboarding a router.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55069 One HA node is missing from the Mist GUI:</strong> Resolved an issue where a managed router had an empty product version config metadata field, which resulted in the conductor version metadata field being cleared.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55164 Dropping GRE encapsulated packets:</strong> Classification support for Enhanced GRE Header, version 1, as defined by RFC 2637 Point-to-Point Tunneling Protocol (PPTP) has been added.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55179 FIPS-enabled SSR Conductors not creating HA connection:</strong> The SSH library used by the initializer was using md5 internally for key identification and logging purposes. Since md5 is not supported with FIPS, it raised an error. The SSH library has been upgraded to use a FIPS compliant key generator.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55203 HA on the last hop router takes too long to failover:</strong> During failover, the multicast state is relearned by the routing engine. Updates have been made to the Graceful Restart (GR) time for multicast to shorten the failover time.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55208 Asset fails to transition state:</strong> In certain cases when the RPM database is corrupted or another process holds its lock indefinitely, the highstate can block forever running rpm -q. Since other highstate attempts see an existing highstate job, they don&#x27;t try to do anything else and the asset stays stuck like that forever without manual intervention.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55244 Unable to initialize DPDK; SSR does not start:</strong> Resolved an issue with the way the initializer identified the amount of memory in the processor. The initializer is now more NUMA aware when sizing the number of hugepages on a system.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55261 Config validation incorrectly being run on router:</strong> Resolved an issue where the plugin validator was running on routers. Validate is now correctly run only on the conductor.</li>

</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55298 KNI interface is generating packets but are being dropped by the SSR:</strong> In a case where a network interface can be configured with a /31 net mask, the SSR will exclude network-interface IP addresses that are point-to-point from source-ip broadcast filtering.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55353 Error message <code>out-of-memory KNI254 management down</code>:</strong> Resolved an issue on systems with a large number of packet forwarding cores, connectivity to the host interface was impaired due to buffer pool depletion. The buffer pool is now scaled to compensate for forwarding core count.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55389 Queries for private domains with Websense classified as Miscellaneous:</strong> Domains categorized by Websense as Uncategorized are now classified as Uncategorized/Uncategorized, rather than Miscellaneous/Uncategorized.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55444 ICMP probe stats missing per service route:</strong> Statistics were not available for ICMP probes that did not meet SLA per service route. These stats have been added.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55454 Dropped packets incorrectly listed as a result of Firewall filter rule:</strong> Firewall filter rules on the network interface can be configured to drop non-ip packets. The non-ip packets were incorrectly classified on the Dropped Packets page. This has been resolved and they are now displayed correctly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55467 Incorrect VLAN Tagging in Azure HCI Stack with Hyper-V Hypervisor:</strong> When using VLANs on Azure HCI Stack with Hyper-V, bit shifting occurs resulting in incorrect VLAN tags. This has been resolved for <strong>non-accelerated NICs</strong> by updating the DPDK and adding handling for the VLAN tags on Azure HCI. However, this issue is still present when using accelerated mode with the Azure HCI Stack with Hyper-V. The current solution is to <strong>not</strong> use accelerated mode if configuring VLAN interfaces.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55470 Allow the configuration of an <code>access-policy deny</code> when a <code>summary service</code> is allowed:</strong> When utilizing <code>router &gt; allow-summary-services true</code> (MIST deployments), a received SVR packet will now be dropped if the locally (FIB) matched service indicates an <code>access-policy deny</code> using the given tenant.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55562 BGP aggregate on router and in Mist intent may cause rare race condition:</strong> Resolved a rare edge case: If an aggregate (summary) is configured in BGP, (e.g., 10.0.0.0/8), and that same prefix also exists as a BGP route present in the network, a race condition may occur and the router with the aggregate configuration may not originate the aggregate.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55578 Traceroute not stopping at the specified <code>destination-ip</code>:</strong> Resolved an issue where traceroute would continue probing after a response from the endpoint, if a subsequent probe timed out.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55586 GraphQL API returns <code>IsActive</code> incorrectly if the <code>device-interface</code> is <code>vrrp_standby</code>:</strong> The <code>router-peer-path</code> setting now returns the correct value when in <code>vrrp-standby</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55591 Some network interface stats are not updated:</strong> Some network interface stats are not updated with the port name when a device interface is renamed. Device interface name changes are now handled correctly, and <code>network-interface</code> metrics are properly updated when <code>device-interface name</code> changes.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55762 Unable to view more than 50 prefixes in BGP:</strong> Updated the routing engine to display all rows for BGP show commands if a count parameter is not specified.</li>

</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55793 Stuck session not being sourceNAT-ed:</strong> In some cases after an interface configuration change, a session was allowed to pass without a <code>source-NAT</code>, leading to stuck sessions.

</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55804 After node restart, stream is lost for approximately 2 minutes on HA router:</strong> During restart the multicast state is relearned by the routing engine. To prevent data loss the routing engine now goes into a Graceful Restart. After the Graceful Restart (GR) all state information is programmed, limiting any traffic loss.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55830 Rollback results in missing Admin user:</strong> Resolved an issue where HA nodes running mixed versions of 5.6.0 or greater with versions less than 5.6.0, the admin user could be temporarily removed until both nodes were upgraded or rolled back to the same version.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55850 Changing the name of a <code>bond-interface</code> fails:</strong> Resolved an issue where changing the name of a <code>bond-interface</code>required a restart to take effect.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-55903 Memory alarm persists in LAG/HA/VRRP configuration:</strong> The <code>Memory exceeded 90%</code> alarm appears and persists in an HA configuration due to multiple database connections being made and not released. These database connections are now properly released and memory use maintained at a reasonable level.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>I95-28073 Support for OSPFv3:</strong> Support for OSPF v3 routing protocol for IPv6 networks. See <a href="/docs/config_ospf">OSPF</a> for additional information and command information.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-40184 SSR Device Configuration Templates:</strong> For conductor-based deployments, fourteen individual templates (for SSR 1x00/SSR1x00 and Juniper certified device) are now provided to simplify configuration. Templates are available from the Templates menu in the GUI.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-46049 Peer Traceroute enhancements:</strong> Additional support has been added to the traceroute command to provide more robust peer, service, and routed traceroute functionality. For more information, refer to <a href="/docs/ts_traceroute">Traceroute</a>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-46120 HA Fabric Warning message supression in Azure:</strong> In Azure, it is not possible to configure a non-forwarding fabric interface on the SSR, thus this error will be present on every commit. This message is now supressed.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-47041 Selection of Mist Cloud instance during whitebox onboarding:</strong> The onboarding interface now silently queries all Mist Instances and provides a drop down selector to allow login to the appropriate Mist instance (Global01, Global03, EU, etc.).</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-47253 Stuck Session Detection:</strong> In situations where forward traffic is received, but there is no reverse traffic; for example, when the local IP of an interface performing source-nat changes, or when the local IP of an interface changes while sending traffic over SVR to a waypoint, the SSR will now mark the session for a flow-move with new reverse flow needed. If the criteria is met, the source-NAT or waypoint will be updated with the correct information on the next forward packet.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51614 Firewall Protection Profile:</strong> Several updates to existing functionality have been made to address firewall filtering. For additional information, see <a href="/docs/sec_firewall_filtering">Customizable Firewall Rules and Filters</a>.<!-- -->
<ul>
<li><strong>Packet Filtering:</strong> Packets can be filtered by any known packet field, and the order in which filters are applied can be set by the user. Filters are configured and applied on the receiving network-interface.</li>
<li><strong>ICMP Filtering:</strong> The SSR matches ICMP error packets with the sessions that generated them, and only accepts those ICMP packets when they match an existing session. Additionally, when configured, ICMP Echo Replies that arrive at the SSR are dropped if no corresponding request has been seen and the ICMP Aysnc Reply is set to drop.</li>
<li><strong>IPv4 Option Filtering:</strong> The SSR has the ability to go deeper than the basic IPv4 header options check and inspect the options to make necessary decisions whether the packets are allowed or dropped and logged.</li>
<li><strong>Transport State Enforcement:</strong> By default, the SSR checks and follows the TCP sequence numbers of all the sessions passing through, and increments the associated metrics. Setting the Transport State Enforcement field to Strict ensures any packets in the TCP stream that fall outside of the sequence number stream will be dropped.</li>
<li><strong>TCP Half-open Connection Limit:</strong> Half-open TCP connections are those where the handshake has started but not completed. The SSR provides the ability to configure a limit to these half-open TCP connections.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51648 Application ID Database Memory Improvements:</strong> Internal improvements have been made to reduce memory consumption of the Application Identification IP database.</li>

<li><strong>The following CVEs have been resolved in this release:</strong> CVE-2022-41974, CVE-2023-32360, CVE-2023-22045, CVE-2023-22049, CVE-2022-41741, CVE-2022-41742, CVE-2020-12321, CVE-2023-2650, CVE-2023-3446, CVE-2023-3817, CVE-2023-3341, CVE-2023-22081, CVE-2022-0934, CVE-2023-46847.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-38188 Repurposing an HA conductor to a standalone conductor left services for the second conductor:</strong> Resolved an issue where the reverse SSH tunnels from a managed router to the second HA conductor node were not cleaned up if the conductor was converted back to a standalone conductor. The salt states now stop services to a second conductor when it is removed from the HA configuration.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-48783 Conductor process logs are unbounded, risking storage exhaustion:</strong> auditd logs consuming the disk space when the node monitor is in a disconnected state and the audit logs are left unconsumed. There was a limit to the log file size, but not the number of files. The number of files is now limited.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50493 Memory calculation for alarms is confusing:</strong> This alarm was designed to trigger when memory usage went above 90% and clear only when memory usage went below 80%, causing confusion. The memory usage alarm no longer requires memory usage to go below 80% to clear; it will clear when memory usage goes below 90%.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50537 Detect and log invalid TCP establishment flags:</strong> TCP packets with illegal flag combinations are dropped before they can set up a session, rather than after.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50540 Denied traffic events not displaying in the GUI or PCLI:</strong> Resolved an issue that prevented displaying denied traffic events in the <code>show events</code> PCLI command and in the GUI. Users would see <code>% Error: Unhandled TypeError: list indices must be integers or slices</code> in the PCLI, and <code>An unknown traffic event occurred</code> in the GUI.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51191 BFD metrics not cleaned up properly:</strong> The BFDAgent holds onto the stats for peer paths; If the config is changed on a router, new stats are made but the old ones were not being deleted. The old BFD by-peer-path stats are now deleted when a VLAN configuration change is made.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52540 Metrics infrastructure resource consumption:</strong> The reporting infrastructure reaching load capacity led to data gaps in custom graphs. Several internal optimizations have been implemented to address this issue. However, to reduce the metrics infrastructure load, metrics in the GUI regarding firmware-generated services, service routes, and tenants will no longer be tracked.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52615 Set TTL multi-hop range correctly:</strong> The TTL multi-hop field allowed a value of 0, but had no impact. The range has been corrected to 1-255, and no longer accepts a value of 0.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53358 Disable/enable of LACP takes the Bond interface down:</strong> Dynamic reconfiguration has been enhanced to support LACP enable/disable while traffic flows by removing the dedicated queue flow (for LACP) when removing a member from bond.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53666 Unable to create webserver certificate request:</strong> This issue has been resolved by providing ACL permissions for the webserver to the certificate directory.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53777 Multicast traffic not passing after an HA failover:</strong> Resolved an issue where the multicast service next hops were not reloading on a configuration change.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53787 Stats not present on conductor:</strong> Running show device-interface router all on a conductor caused stats (in-octets, in-unicast-pkts, etc...) to be incorrectly displayed as &quot;n/a&quot; instead of the correct value. This issue has been resolved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53851 DHCP server scripts return false positive:</strong> During the creation process, the DHCP scripts check the server name for an existing namespace. The script would return a false positive if the configured name was a substring of an existing name. Resolved an issue where a DHCP server won&#x27;t come up if the device port is a substring of another device port that is also configured as a DHCP server.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53852 host-service snmp-server blocks SVR pings to a network-interface owned address:</strong> Ping traffic was hitting the generated (wildcarded) snmp-server service. The session could not setup due to security policy conflicts. This issue has been resolved; the generated service from an snmp-server host-service now has a UDP transport.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53858 Active sessions counter continuously incrementing:</strong> The SSC active sessions counter has been updated to correctly handle session removal.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53875 The <code>show stats service-area sent success</code> metric was retained longer than needed:</strong> Resolved an issue where the <code>stats default retention short</code> setting was not being honored.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53907 SSR readvertising SA to MSDP mesh peers:</strong> Resolved an issue where MSDP SA&#x27;s received from a mesh-group peer were being re-advertised to the mesh-group. This issue has been resolved by verifying sender of the SA.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-53915 Removing an X710/X722 port from SSR can cause high RX latency:</strong> Deleting an SSR interface from an X710/722 NIC which is part of a multi-port device introduces RX latency into sibling ports until the SSR is restarted. This has been resolved by enabling the i40e “multi-driver” mode to preserve global registers that are shared across ports.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54051 Broadcom driver causing memory corruption, leading to a system fault:</strong> Updated the driver support for BNXT NICs.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54091 Software Lifecycle History page does not load:</strong> A time selector has been added to allow the user to provide parameters around the amount of data that is loaded.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54126 VRRP HA - EoSVR to VRRP HA - EoSVR not recovering after failure:</strong> When EoSVR is enabled, VRRP packets (which are multicast frames) are not detected as destined for the SSR and are being classified as non-IP frames that should be encapsulated for EoSVR. To resolve this issue, detection/classification enhancements have been made to recognize VRRP packets that match the configured VRID and not forward them in the EoSVR tunnel.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54133 IDP severity grouping mislabeled:</strong> Resolved an issue where minor severity levels were labeled incorrectly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54155 nodeMonitor coredump on secondary node after upgrade:</strong> During an upgrade where <code>deviceType</code> was <code>LTE</code> the attempt to get a linux interface name (not supported) failed. This issue has been resolved by implementing a device interface type verification.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54180 Unable to fetch reports from Conductor GUI:</strong> A refactor moved the connectivity check exception, which prevented a service restart. This has been resolved, and the stats now being written to the database and GUI tables.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54199 Image based installation hangs in Azure:</strong> Resolved a dependency issue causing a race condition between Azure and the SSR setup; azure agent requires networking, but <code>t128-firstboot-setup.sh</code> must run before network startup to configure the NIC names. The dependencies have been correctly sequenced.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54265 Schema not included in API response for a template:</strong> The <code>schema</code> object has been added to the API.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54294 Unable to delete capture-filter created with <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator:</strong> Resolved an issue that disallowed deleting capture-filters containing <code>&amp;&amp;</code>. Customers on older versions of software can work around this by creating capture-filters using <code>and</code> instead of <code>&amp;&amp;</code>.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54398 ASM - Prune flag set incorrectly:</strong> Resolved an issue with how outgoing interfaces in the mroute entry are reported. If the outgoing interface list only contains PIM SVR interfaces, the P flag was displayed incorrectly. The outgoing interface list is populated correctly, and the P flag now shows correctly.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54434 Mist PCAP failure - inverted commands observed by the device:</strong> In rare cases where captures are created and deleted too quickly, a delete command may be received by the device before the create command. These timing issues have been resolved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54490 Permission denied when trying to open a user config file:</strong> Resolved a permissions issue for the <code>connect router</code> command by adding ACLs for reverse SSH so that this is accessible for admin users.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>WAN-1958 Mist agent crashes:</strong> Increased internal file system limits which were preventing some services from starting correctly at boot. Limits were raised based on expected system usage.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="caveats">Caveats<a href="#caveats" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to Caveats" title="Direct link to Caveats">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54780 Forwarding Utilization stats are not retained beyond one hour:</strong> This issue is the result of the fix in place for the <code>stats default retention short</code> setting was not being honored (I95-53875). This will be resolved in the next patch release.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-54856 Rollback issue after upgrade to 6.2 from versions 6.1 or earlier:</strong> If the SSR is upgraded from 6.1 (or older) to 6.2 and you have BGP neighbors with address family configuration, and then try to downgrade to a version prior to 6.2, the downgrade will fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>That configuration looks like this:</p>
<div class="codeBlockContainer_Ckt0 theme-code-block" style="--prism-color:#bfc7d5;--prism-background-color:#292d3e"><div class="codeBlockContent_biex"><pre tabindex="0" class="prism-code language-text codeBlock_bY9V thin-scrollbar" style="color:#bfc7d5;background-color:#292d3e"><code class="codeBlockLines_e6Vv"><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">		neighbor 172.16.0.1</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">    		neighbor-as 300</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">        		address-family ipv4-unicast</span><br></span><span class="token-line" style="color:#bfc7d5"><span class="token plain">             		&lt;anything&gt;</span><br></span></code></pre><div class="buttonGroup__atx"><button type="button" aria-label="Copy code to clipboard" title="Copy" class="clean-btn"><span class="copyButtonIcons_eSgA" aria-hidden="true"><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonIcon_y97N"><path fill="currentColor" d="M19,21H8V7H19M19,5H8A2,2 0 0,0 6,7V21A2,2 0 0,0 8,23H19A2,2 0 0,0 21,21V7A2,2 0 0,0 19,5M16,1H4A2,2 0 0,0 2,3V17H4V3H16V1Z"></path></svg><svg viewBox="0 0 24 24" class="copyButtonSuccessIcon_LjdS"><path fill="currentColor" d="M21,7L9,19L3.5,13.5L4.91,12.09L9,16.17L19.59,5.59L21,7Z"></path></svg></span></button></div></div></div>
<p>The downgrade fails because a new default <code>disable</code> value for the <code>remove-private-as</code> option was added under the neighbor address family. This value is present in the configuration under <code>neighbor address-family</code> even if it was not explicitly configured.</p>
<p><strong>Workaround Options:</strong></p>
<p>Delete the <code>neighbor address-family</code> container from the configuration before the downgrade. <strong>It is recommended to make a copy of the <code>neighbor address-family</code> configuration</strong>, because you will need to add it back after the downgrade.</p>
<p>Explicitly configure <code>remove-private-as</code> to one of the other valid values. It is recommended to review your BGP configuration before making any of the below changes, as they may have an impact.</p>
<p>Valid values for <code>remove-as-path</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>all</code>: Remove all private AS in the AS path.</li>
<li><code>replace-all</code>: Replace all private AS with the local AS.</li>
<li><code>only</code>: Remove private AS only if the AS path contains just private AS.</li>
<li><code>replace-only</code>: Replace private AS with the local AS only if the AS path contains just private AS.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-42466 Changing the physical linux address of an HA interface breaks the configuration:</strong> Resolved an issue where moving a non-forwarding fabric HA sync device-interface from one PCI address to another PCI address would not properly clean up the team interface from the old PCI address.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-47838 SSR does not remove networks on stop:</strong> Resolved an issue where the SSR does not remove networks on stop. This has been corrected and the SSR now will cleanup networks on container stop and create them on restart to optimize start/restart process.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-48346 BGP peering between two SSRs not coming up:</strong> When a network interface is configured with tenant-prefixes and these match a BGP neighbor, then that neighbor cannot establish a connection with the router. The SSR now creates FIB entries that allow communication from routing protocol neighbors.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50539 SSR not handling and logging Multicast packets correctly:</strong> Per security best practices, the SSR now filters and drops packets if the source address is a multicast source IP address.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50671 Office365 traffic is not recognized:</strong> Resolved an issue where Office365 traffic was being miscategorized and therefore not fully qualified. O365 traffic, when traversing over SVR, is no longer miscategorized.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-50708 Time series data for memory of the salt_master process periodically significantly decreases:</strong> Incorrect method for polling application memory data; this resulted in dips in application memory being presented. This issue has been resolved.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51492 Password expiration not working:</strong> This issue has been resolved. Adminstrators must use the global setting <code>configure authority password-policy lifetime N </code> to indicate that all user passwords must be changed every <code>N</code> days.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51638 Traceroute does not complete over SSR, but does using linux:</strong> The traceroute command was unable to resolve through some network elements. The default SSR traceroute UDP port number has been changed to a more common/recognized port.</li>

<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51801 The SSR is unable to see DHCP ACK for the DHCP Request sent by an EX4100:</strong> Added an <code>authoritative</code> field for DHCP servers to enable/disable <code>authoritative</code> mode, which allows the server to send a NAK in response to unknown clients. This field is set to <code>true</code> by default.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51864 Ethernet Over SVR (EoSVR) not working for multi-hop SVR scenarios:</strong> When EoSVR traffic traverses over a dogleg path in a HA node topology, traffic failed to traverse the middle node. EoSVR packets are no longer incorrectly dropped when routed over an inter-node path when coming from an SVR path.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-51992 Multi-queue support for Bond interfaces:</strong> Support for a bond <code>device-interface</code> to use multiple RX/TX queues has been added.</li>

</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52158 Spoke is rejecting hub BFD packets, and peering is unable to come up over LTE:</strong> In a corner case where the spoke private LTE IP changes before BFD is up and the public/hub-received IP stays the same, the hub gets stuck in the init state.
This issue has been resolved; the LTE IP change is now handled it as a source-nat change, where the flows and actions can be recreated with the updated LTE private IP.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52178 Reset of SSR IDP does not turn it off:</strong> Resolved an issue when performing a factory reset on SSR IDP did not turn it off properly.</li>

</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52547 Unable to set DHCP option 160:</strong> Resolved an issue where DHCP option 160 was being treated as a standard option and was unavailable to be defined as an option. When it was set, it would prevent the DHCP server from starting. This has been corrected.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52599 Conductors display different assets on different HA nodes:</strong> If the state table of an inactive HA node becomes out of sync with the active HA node, then some assets were being skipped when parsing the asset state response. This issue has been resolved through the reporting of asset IDs from the active node state table.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52822 ARP fails to resolve:</strong> An earlier change caused ports on an X553 that use SFPs to no longer correctly report link status. This issue has been resolved and the link status is now reported accurately.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52855 DHCP Relay stopped functioning after removing disabled DHCP Servers:</strong> When a number of disabled DHCP servers were deleted from the configuration, the server interface mappings were deleted as well.

</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52859 Issue moving interface between chassis of hypervisor platforms running SSR (e.g., ENCS):</strong> When swapping physical cable from active node to standby node, the customer experienced low rate packet loss on traffic-engineering enabled device-interfaces. To resolve this issue, the traffic-engineering transmit-cap is no longer ignored on device-interfaces which have unresolved link-speed.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<ul>
<li><strong>I95-52889 Highway crash caused by a false negative waypoint exhaustion check:</strong> Waypoint ports reinitialization that is triggered by a false negative exhaustion check can lead to duplicate waypoints and reverse flows on two sessions resulting in a highway crash. This issue has been resolved.</li>
