The 128T Conductor is a 128T instance that is used to manage the 128T Routers you configure within the same Authority. It offers centralized administration, provisioning, monitoring, and analytics. 

The Authority is where system-wide data is stored. Conceptually, the Authority represents the complete set of all 128T Routers managed under a single organizational entity. Service configuration, which represents the cornerstone of the 128T Routerâ€™s worldview, is part of the set of global data within an authority. Services represent specific applications that a network delivers; e.g., web services, database services, or voice/video services. Each Authority is uniquely named, in the same way a domain name is unique.

To complete a base configuration of the Conductor, name the Authority, and configure the web server as a service.
