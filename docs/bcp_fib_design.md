This document has provided a lot of detailed information on the FIB. Letâ€™s summarize some best practices when considering your SSR network design.

### Complexity

Avoid complex transport configurations in a service. It can be seen from the examples in this document that transport overlap can account for many potential conflicts in the FIB. Services with multiple port-range entries across multiple transports can make this difficult to track. If your configuration calls for scenarios with many port-ranges, consider breaking these out into multiple services. The end results will not create more FIB entries. On the left hand side below is an example from earlier in this document. The right hand side shows an example of these services broken out into multiple services which would result in equivalent FIB entries and reduce the risk of encountering unexpected transport overlap.

### FIB Matching

Enable fib-service-match any-match at the beginning of a deployment. This configuration parameter has not always existed in SSR code. Since the result of configuring this option more closely matches what a user typically expects for the intent of their configuration, it is suggested to enable this at the start of any new deployment. For existing deployments, great care should be taken to compare existing configuration to existing RIB to ensure that changing this value does not result in overloading the FIB on deployed systems.

### BGP over SVR

When using BGP over SVR, be careful when choosing routing interface address space. It should not conflict with useable network space in the deployment. Addresses in link local address space (169.254.0.0/16) can be used and is recommended.
