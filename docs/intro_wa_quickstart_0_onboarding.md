Congratulations on your new Session Smart Routing (SSR) WAN Edge device!

Let's get it set up in the Mist cloud with WAN Assurance.

## Connect Your Device to the Cloud

<img src="/img/intro_wa_ssr120_quickstart_1.png" alt="Device Connections" width="500"/>

Your SSR device uses port 0 (`ge-0`) as a default WAN port to contact Mist for zero-touch provisioning (ZTP). Also you will set up port 3 (`ge-3`) with a LAN network.

1. **Connect port 0** to an Ethernet WAN link capable of providing the device with:
    * DHCP address assignment
    * Connectivity Internet and Mist

2. **Connect port 3** to your LAN devices, including:
    * Mist-managed Juniper EX switches
    * Mist APs
    * User devices

3. **Power on the device**.

## Claim Your Device

Great job! Your SSR device is now connected to the Mist cloud and awaiting further instructions.
