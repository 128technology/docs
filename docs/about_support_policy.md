description: "This document defines the product lifecycle support policy for Juniper Networks, Inc.'s SSN software products. The policy includes software maintenance, software support, and end-of-life."

When a software product approaches End of Life (EOL), it is the policy of Juniper Networks to communicate these important milestones to our customers. EOL dates for the SSR are posted on the [Session Smart Router Dates & Milestones](https://support.juniper.net/support/eol/software/ssr/) page on the Juniper website.

For specific information regarding the End of Life policy, please see the [Juniper Networks Product End of Life Policy](https://support.juniper.net/support/pdf/eol/juniper-networks-end-of-life-policy-procedure.pdf), which is also linked from the Session Smart Router Dates & Milestones page linked above.
