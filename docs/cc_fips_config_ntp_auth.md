Support for NTP authentication allows external NTP servers to be authenticated using an `md5` or `sha1` hash, allowing the SSR to verify the identity of the server being used for NTP time synchronization.

To allow the NTP client to synchronize with an authenticated server the following information must be provided:

- **Server ip-address:** This is required.
- **Key-number:** The specific number used by the server to identify the key. Range is 1-65534. The number configured on the device must match the key number expected by the server.
- **Authentication type:** Either `md5` or `sha1` (recomended)
- **Shared key from the server:** 20 characters long for `md5`. 40 characters long for `sha1`.

Example config:

```
authority
    name Authority128
    router Fabric128
        name Fabric128
        system
            ntp
                server 1.1.1.1
                    ip-address  1.1.1.1
                    authentication-key
                        key-number 1
                        type md5
                        value ay4SZtX$VuooRx9XD+d+
                    exit
                exit
            exit
        exit
    exit
exit
```
