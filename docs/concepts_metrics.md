When querying the `STATS` API, you will notice the resolution of the data changes over time.  This is due to the downsampling that occurs. Downsampling is performed to reduce the amount of data persisted to disk, ultimately purging the data from the system after a period of time.

The system samples data every 5 seconds. The sampling interval is configurable under `authority > router > system > metrics > sample-period <value>`.
:::note
It is not recommended to change the sample-period. Increasing the value reduces the resolution of the information collected. Decreasing the value creates a greater computational load on the system. The software has been tuned to operate optimally at a sampling interval of 5 seconds.
:::
- The full resolution of 5 second sampled data is kept for 1 hour.
- Every five minutes, the sampled data is aggregated. The 5 minute values are kept for a day.
- Every hour the 5 minute values are aggregated. The 1 hour values are kept for 6 months.
- After 6 months, the data is purged from disk.

### In Memory Metrics
By default, not all metrics are persisted to disk and subject to downsampling. When executing `show stats` commands utilizing the `since` argument, the command reports that the requested data is unavailable.

To view in-memory metrics, create a Metrics Profile containing the specific metrics to be collected and persisted. For information about creating a Metrics Profile to collect your metrics, see [Configuring In-Memory Metrics](config_in-memory_metrics.md).

Care should be taken to avoid overloading the system with the metrics. Many metrics are currently in-memory because of the heavy load they introduce to the system if they were all persisted. 

An Example of `show stats` command using a `since` argument is shown below:

```
admin@node.router# show stats ipfix since 5:30
Tue 2020-03-15 13:07:06 UTC

```

The since argument is a general utility which performs a delta between the two values supplied by the arguments. The primary use is for cumulative metrics - ones that keep incrementing. Some stats are stored as a rate, which are a per 5 second view of the stat. A rate valeu in the past may be higher then the current rate (or rate at the selected time) and therefor a negative value may be returned.

## Session Establishment Metrics
A key indicator of application performance is the time it takes to establish the TCP session between client and server. This is effectively the time it takes to get to the first data packet between endpoints. This metric is more telling than packet transmission rates because it is directional and end to end. Importantly, this information can be used as a measure of SLA to influence path selection.

Session establishment metrics have been created and are gathered on a per service, per interface, per destination, per traffic-class basis. This level of granularity provides surgically accurate information on how the network treatment and performance is impacting application behavior. A capability that is unique only to the SSR router.

To add more context to the sessions traversing the SSR router, the newly added session establishment metrics detailed below are collected in protocol based buckets *TCP*, *UDP*, *ICMP*, and *TLS*. Each protocol has its own determination of what qualifications need to be met for a session to become *established*. In turn there is protocol/application-specific handling of each of these, defined by what is considered *established*.  For the remainder of the document, the following definitions of establishment are implied per protocol:

- **TCP** - session has seen an acknowledgement to the first packet after the TCP handshake that contains payload
- **UDP** - session has seen a packet in the reverse direction
- **ICMP** - session has seen a packet in the reverse direction
- **TLS** - session has seen an acknowledgement to the first packet after the TLS handshake that contains payload

### Time to Establish
This is a grouping of 3 different metrics: min, max, and mean. The time from session start to when it reaches the established state as defined above per-protocol. The exception is for TLS, the start time is at TCP establishment instead of session start.

### Session Close Before TCP Establishment

### Configuration
In order to begin collection of the metrics described above, a service-route must be configured to enable reachability-detection.

Example:

```
service-route
  name                   service-agent1
  nat-target             1.2.3.4
  service-name           web
  service-route-policy   sap1
  reachability-detection
    enabled     true
  next-hop
    node-name   slice1
    interface   intf1
    gateway-ip  1.1.1.2
```

In order to filter reachability by destination prefix by traffic class:
