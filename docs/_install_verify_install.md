<!---Verify Installation --->

After installing the SSR Software it is important to verify that the installation was completed successfully.

### To Verify the SSR Installation:

1. Launch a command prompt window.

2. Execute the command:

  ```
  sudo systemctl status 128T
  ```

3. When the service is listed as _Active_, log into the system as Admin using the system default password. By logging into the system, you have verified the installation. 

4. Close the command prompt window. 

5. Use a web browser to navigate to the IP address of the SSR GUI. For example; `https://192.168.1.25`

6. Log in to the SSR GUI using the admin name and password you created earlier.
