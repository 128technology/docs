This guide describes the process for deploying a Session Smart Conductor or a Session Smart Router (SSR) in VMWare ESXi. The process consists of the following steps:

- Download the SSR package-based or image-based ISO. Refer to [Downloading ISOs](intro_downloading_iso.md)
- Log into VMware ESXi with Administrative rights
- Create a new Virtual Machine and configure
- Boot Virtual Machine to run the Juniper SSR ISO and install software

## VMWare Configuration

In order to perform the configuration and installation of the SSR software, you must have a properly installed and working configuration of VMware ESXi. This documentation references VMware ESXi version 7.0.0, however, the software has been tested on earlier versions. Additoinally, you must have administrator access to the ESXi platform.

## Procedure

1. Log in to your VMWare ESXi instance as the Administrator.

2. Load the SSR ISO into the ESXi Data Store. 

	- From the ESXi Navigator in the left hand pane, select Storage.
	- Select the **Datastore Browser** button.

	-  Click **Close** to continue.

3. From the ESXi Navigator select **Virtual Machines**.

### Define the Virtual Machine

1. Click on **Create / Register VM**.
2. Select **Create a new virtual machine** and click **Next**.

#### Virtual Machine Name and OS

1. Enter a name for the virtual machine. The name should indicate whether the instance is a router or conductor, and provide other information such as the physical location.
2. Set compatibility to **ESXi 5.5 virtual machine**.
3. Set the Guest OS family to: `Linux`.
4. Set the Guest OS version to: `CentOS 4/5/6/7 (64-bit)` and click **Next**.

#### Customize Settings

6. Select **Virtual Hardware**.
7. Expand the CPU selection, and configure the following settings:

	- Set the number of CPU’s to at least 4.
	- Update the **Scheduling Affinity** to `0-3`.

	Close the CPU list and configure the following under Virtual Hardware:

	- Set memory to a minimum of 8GB.
	- Set hard disk 1 to a minimum of 26GB.
	- Set the SCSI Controller 0 to `LSI Logic SAS`.
