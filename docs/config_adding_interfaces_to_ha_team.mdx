The information below is a Juniper best practice for adding interfaces to the HA sync team interface, and is simplified by using the the [HA Sync Redundancy Plugin](plugin_ha_sync_redundancy.mdx). The HA Sync Redundancy plugin adds the ability to include an additional link in the team interface configured as described in [Non-Forwarding HA Interfaces](config_non_forwarding_ha_interfaces.md). Additionally, the plugin provides the ability to use the HA sync connection (single or dual-member) to send HA fabric traffic by creating a vlan sub-interface, and setting up a KNI interface in a bridge with this sub-interface.
