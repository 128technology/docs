## `commit`

Commit the candidate config as the new running config.

#### Usage

```
commit [force] [validate-local]
```

##### Keyword Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| force | Skip confirmation prompt |
| validate-local | Only validate the configuration on the Conductor |

#### Description

The `commit` command causes the 128T router to validate the candidate configuration, and then replace the running configuration with the candidate configuration (assuming it passes the validation step). It is used once a series of configuration changes have been made, and an administrator wishes to &quot;activate&quot; those configuration changes.

When run from a 128T conductor, the conductor will first validate the configuration itself before distributing configuration to all of its managed routers for each of them to validate the configuration. After the managed routers have all reported the results of their validation, the commit activity takes place (assuming a successful validation). This distributed validation can be skipped by using the validate-local keyword argument.

The `commit` command will prompt a user for confirmation, as this is a (potentially) service affecting command. By supplying the optional `force` keyword, the confirmation step is skipped:

```
*admin@labsystem1.fiedler# commit
Are you sure you want to commit the candidate config? [y/N]: y
Configuration committed

*admin@labsystem1.fiedler# commit force
Configuration committed
admin@labsystem1.fiedler#
```
If the validation step fails, the administrator will be notified, the commit step is not executed, and the existing running configuration will remain in place. The validator will get a list of all errors that must be addressed before the commit can be completed. There may also be warnings displayed in the event that the candidate configuration contains elements that are deprecated.

#### Example

```
*admin@burl-corp-primary.burl-corp# commit
âœ– Validating, then committing...
% Error: Failed to commit:
1. Service name "bar" does not exist

    config
        authority
            router burl-corp
                service-route foo
                    service-name

2. A service route must have at least one next-hop, peer,
nat-target, use-learned-routes, routing-stack or host configured. It cannot have both
the peer and nat-target configured.

    config
        authority
            router burl-corp
                service-route foo

3. Service-route foo for service '' is not allowed on router burl-corp. Please check the applies-to config
on the service.

    config
        authority
            router burl-corp
                service-route foo
```

## `compare config`

Display the differences between two configurations.

#### Usage

```
compare config [<old>] [<new>]
```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| old | The original configuration against which differences should be computed (default: running). Can be _candidate_, _running_, _factory-defaults_, or the name of a previously exported configuration. |
| new | The updated configuration for which differences should be computed. Can be _candidate_, _running_, _factory-defaults_, or the name of a previously exported configuration. |

#### Description

The `compare config` command presents a list of differences between the two configurations specified as arguments on the command line. The one listed first influences the output in a very important way: the 128T router will return a list of configuration commands that will cause the configuration to be listed _first_ to be brought to parity with the one listed _second_. (Note: since the only editable configuration is the &quot;candidate&quot; configuration, the changes outlined by the _compare config_ command cannot be directly applied to the &quot;running&quot; configuration.)

The ability to specify _a previously exported configuration file_ to compare against the running or candidate config allows you to compare configurations **without** having to import the exported config into the candidate config for comparison. 

In the example below, the candidate and running configurations are identical save for a single _service-route_ that has been added to the candidate configuration.

```
*admin@labsystem1.fiedler# compare config running candidate

config
    authority
        router  Fabric128
            name           Fabric128
            service-route  myRoute
                name          myRoute
                service-name  myService
                destination   10.10.10.10
            exit
        exit
    exit
exit
```

This shows that the running configuration is missing the candidate's service-route. By reversing the order of the arguments, the output changes:

```
*admin@labsystem1.fiedler# compare config candidate running

config
    authority
        router  Fabric128
            name           Fabric128
            delete service-route force myRoute
        exit
    exit
exit
```

Note here that the output shows that the running configuration has _deleted the candidate configuration's service-route_ via the `delete service-route force myRoute` statement. Cutting and pasting this configuration into the PCLI will affect the candidate configuration â€“ and make it match the running configuration.

When two configurations are identical, comparing them will return that there are no changes to display:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# compare config candidate running

# No differences
admin@labsystem1.fiedler#
```

## configure

#### Usage
```
configure [authority [ ... ] ]
```

#### Description

The `configure` command places administrators into the configuration tree (hierarchy), where they will be making changes to the _candidate configuration_. When entered as a standalone command (i.e., `configure` by itself), the administrator is placed at the top of the configuration tree.

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# configure
admin@labsystem.beacon (config)#
```

Alternatively, administrators may execute the `configure` command with optional arguments to enter into configuration mode "deeper" in the configuration tree. For example:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# configure authority router Fabric128
admin@labsystem1.fiedler (router[name=Fabric128])#
```

By supplying optional arguments to the configure command as in the above example, the administrator has entered into the configuration tree at the "router" tier, within the router element named "Fabric128". Not only can administrators enter into the configuration tree at any point through this technique, but new configuration can also applied directly in this same way.

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# configure auth router Fabric128 description "sample description"
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show config candidate

config

    authority
        name      Authority128

        router    Fabric128
            name                 Fabric128
            location             usa
            description          "sample description"
...
```
#### Required Fields
Some arguments and subcommands contain required fields for configuration. The `configure` help text now identifies required fields. For example:
```
...
usage: inter-node-security [<security-ref>]

The name of the security policy used for inter node communication between router interfaces

positional arguments:
security-ref    The value to set for this field

security-ref (leafref) (required): This type is used by other entities that need to reference configured security policies. 

Options: internal, aes1, or test
```

#### Description

The _edit prompt_ command lets administrators change the display of the PCLI prompt, and includes a flexible array of options for customizability. In addition to various variables, the prompt string can include conditional statements, to affect the display of the prompt under different operating modes. All of this is accomplished by supplying a _format string_, which contains the syntax of the desired PCLI prompt.
```
State Variables
===============

{user}      - Name of the currently logged in user
{address}   - Address (node.router) of the current system
{node}      - Name of the connected node
{router}    - Name of the connected router
{context}   - Currently set context if one is set; empty otherwise
{path}      - Full path to the current PCLI menu, separated by &#x27;/&#x27;
{location}  - Name of current PCLI menu
{privilege} - &quot;#&quot; if the current user has administrator privileges, else &quot;&gt;&quot;

Conditional Variables
=====================

{top-level}  - Evaluates true if the PCLI is at the top menu
{uncomitted} - Evaluates true if the candidate configuration differs from the running configuration

Conditionals
============

A conditional statement allows the prompt to be customized with conditional or state variables

The format of a conditional statement is:

    [condition?value_if_true:value_if_false]

The condition is true if a state variable is not an empty string or if a conditional variable is true

For example:

    'This prompt is [top-level?definitely:not] top level'

Yields one of the following:

    'This prompt is definitely top level' (if top-level is true or has a value)

    'This prompt is not top level' (if top-level is false or has no value)

Timestamps
==========

Custom timestamps are created with the use of standard strftime format codes

For example:

    '(%x %H:%M) {user}@{address}$ '

Yields:

    '(03/08/17 11:46) admin@node.router$ '

See <https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html#strftime-strptime-behavior> for all format codes

Any '?'s that appear in a timestamp must be escaped with a '\'

Special characters*
==================

\n - Newline
\t - Tab
\[ - Literal '['
\] - Literal ']'
{{ - Literal '{'
}} - Literal '}'
%% - Literal '%'

* Use \\ if not using a quoted string to specify the prompt
```

#### Description

The _edit user_ command enters a configuration subtree specific to administering user accounts. From within this subtree, administrators can change any of the attributes associated with a user account (full name, password, role, and enabled state). This is done in a "configuration-like" way, where commands are issued as _attribute value_.

As with standard configuration, using the &amp;quot;?&amp;quot; command will list the options available for editing.

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# edit user jdeveloper
admin@labsystem1.fiedler (user[name=jdeveloper])# ?

User Attributes
---------------
enabled      Enable or disable this user.
full-name    The user's full name, for display purposes only.
password     No help available
role         A list of roles assigned to the user.

General Commands
----------------
delete       Delete an attribute from a user account
do           Execute a top-level command
exit         Exit this menu (You can also press Ctrl+D)
quit         Quit the PCLI
top          Return to the root menu
up           Exit this menu and navigate up the hierarchy the given number of levels
where        Display the current location in the CLI hierarchy

admin@labsystem1.fiedler (user[name=jdeveloper])#
```
Modifying these attributes is done as follows:
```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler (user[name=jdeveloper])# full-name "Joseph Developer"
Account 'jdeveloper' updated successfully
admin@labsystem1.fiedler (user[name=jdeveloper])# top
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show user jdeveloper

=============================
 Information for jdeveloper:
=============================
 Enabled: true
 Full Name: Joseph Developer
 Role: admin
admin@labsystem1.fiedler#

| [`show events config commit`](#show-events-config-commit) | Shows events related to running config change |
| [`show stats config`](#show-stats-config) | Metrics pertaining to the get-config RPC |

#### Description

The _export_ command takes a configuration from a previously created backup (via _create config backup_), from the candidate configuration, or from the 128T router&#x27;s running configuration, and stores it as a file on the local filesystem. It can then be taken off, moved onto other systems, archived, etc.

Exported files are stored in /etc/128technology/config-backups/ and are stored as GZIP compressed files.

The _export_ command&#x27;s complement, _import_ is used to reverse the process, taking a configuration archive and restoring it onto a system.

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# export config candidate myCandidate
Successfully exported configuration: /etc/128technology/config-exports/myCandidate.gz
admin@labsystem1.fiedler#
```

| [`delete certificate webserver`](#delete-certificate-webserver) | Delete the webserver certificate. |
| [`show certificate webserver`](#show-certificate-webserver) | Display the webserver certificate |

#### Description

This command allows administrators to load certificates into their 128T router by pasting them into their active PCLI session. By issuing the `import certificate` command, the PCLI prompts the user for the name of the certificate they plan to import, then asks whether it is a CA (certificate authority) certificate or not. Once these questions are answered, administrators can paste the certificate, and is reminded to press CTRL-D once the pasting is complete. Pressing CTRL-D causes the 128T router to validate the configuration to ensure it is a valid X.509 certificate before loading it into persistent storage. If the X.509 validation fails, the user is informed as follows:

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# import certificate webserver
Enter the CA certificate in PEM format (Press CTRL-D to finish):
Certificate is not in valid X509 format
admin@labsystem1.fiedler#
```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |

#### Description

This issues ICMP requests to the specified _destination-ip_ merely as a connectivity test, and bypasses the typical packet processing logic that would potentially restrict access to various tenants and destined for service addresses. The _count_ modifier will affect the number of pings that are issued. The _interface_ modifier lets administrators specify the egress interface for issuing the pings. The _timeout_ modifier will set the waiting period for a reply before declaring the ping as a failure. The _set-df-bit_ and _record-route_ options enable the respective flags in the outgoing ICMP request.

#### Example

```
admin@gouda.novigrad# ping egress-interface wan-interface 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 56 bytes of data.
Ping from 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): icmp_seq=0 ttl=57 time=12.97ms
Ping from 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): icmp_seq=1 ttl=57 time=10.597ms
Ping from 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): icmp_seq=2 ttl=57 time=10.643ms
Ping from 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): icmp_seq=3 ttl=57 time=10.444ms
```

#### Description

The _replace_ command is a powerful tool for making sweeping configuration changes, similar to a &quot;find and replace&quot; operation in a word processor.
The _replace_ command has several optional arguments that affect how the replacement occurs; _case-sensitive_ will only match elements within the configuration that match the case supplied with the _query_ string. The _regex_ argument treats the query string as a regular expression. The _whole-word_ argument requires that the match be an entire word, rather than just a substring or partial match.

The user-supplied _query string_ and _replacement string_ are the matching text, and the replacement text, respectively.

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# replace config all internal newInternal
Replacing 'config authority router RTR_EAST_CONDUCTOR inter-node-security internal' with 'newInternal'...
Replacing 'config authority router RTR_EAST_COMBO inter-node-security internal' with 'newInternal'...

## `rotate log`

Rotate log files.

#### Usage

```
rotate log [force] [router <router>] [node <node>] [<process-name>]
```

##### Keyword Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| force | Skip confirmation prompt. Only required when targeting all routers |
| node | The node for which to rotate logfiles |
| router | The router for which to rotate logfiles (default: &lt;current router&gt;) |

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| process-name | The process for which to rotate logfiles (default: all) |

##### See Also

| command | description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [`set log level`](#set-log-level) | Set the log level of a process. |
| [`write log message`](#write-log-message) | Write a message to the log. |
| [`write log snapshot`](#write-log-snapshot) | Write a snapshot to the log. |

#### Description

This command is used to rotate log files (i.e., close the current log file and open a new one) generated by the various processes that comprise the 128T router to rotate. The 128T router&#x27;s log files, stored in `/var/log/128technology`, keep 25 prior logs for each process, space permitting. Files are rotated such that, for instance, pcli.log becomes pcli.1.log while pcli.1.log becomes pcli.2.log, and so on. The oldest log file for each process is removed.

The _rotate log_ command is useful prior to engaging in troubleshooting exercises, to help narrow down which files may contain items of interest. It is particularly useful when used in conjunction with the _write_ command, described elsewhere in this document.

Without any arguments, the _rotate log_ command will rotate all log files on all nodes.

For more information about 128T logging read [Understanding Logs on the 128T](ts_logs.md)

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# rotate log
Logs successfully rotated
admin@labsystem1.fiedler#
```
The optional arguments _process-name_ and _node-name_ let administrators specify which processes should rotate their logs, and on which nodes.
```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# shell ls -ltr /var/log/128technology/ | grep highwayManager
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    14964 Oct  8 05:34 highwayManager.4.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    35908 Oct  8 05:42 highwayManager.3.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    10653 Oct 11 11:12 highwayManager.2.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   146057 Oct 11 11:42 highwayManager.1.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   117673 Oct 11 14:48 highwayManager.log
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# rotate log highwayManager labsystem1
Logs successfully rotated

admin@labsystem1.fiedler# shell ls -ltr /var/log/128technology/ | grep highwayManager
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    14964 Oct  8 05:34 highwayManager.5.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    35908 Oct  8 05:42 highwayManager.4.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root    10653 Oct 11 11:12 highwayManager.3.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   146057 Oct 11 11:42 highwayManager.2.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root   117673 Oct 11 14:48 highwayManager.1.log
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root        0 Oct 12 09:45 highwayManager.log
```
In this example you can see that what was previously named highwayManager.4.log has been _rotated_ to highwayManager.5.log; likewise, all other logs were incremented. What was highwayManager.log is now highwayManager.1.log, and a new highwayManager.log file has been created, and is empty.

service-ping [count <count>] [size <size>] [timeout <timeout>] [set-df-bit] [service-name <service-name>] [tenant <tenant>] [source-ip <source-ip>] router <router> node <node> <destination-ip>
```

##### Keyword Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| count | Number of ping requests to send [type: int] (default: 4) |
| node | The node from which to send the ping request |
| router | The router from which to send the ping request |
| service-name | Name of service which includes the destination trying to be reached; only required if service is ambiguous |
| set-df-bit | Set the IPv4 &#x27;Don&#x27;t Fragment&#x27; bit on the request packet |
| size | Number of data bytes to send [type: int] (default: 56) |
| source-ip | IP from which to test whether traffic is allowed [type: IP address] |
| tenant | Name of source tenant for ICMP request (default is the global tenant) |
| timeout | Time to wait for a response, in seconds [max: 10 seconds] [type: int] (default: 1) |

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| destination-ip | Destination IP of the ping request [type: IP address] |

#### Description

This issues ICMP requests to the specified _destination-ip_, and offers the administrators a variety of ways to formulate the request. The _tenant_ and _service-name_ modifiers specify which "source tenant" to use for the request, and the name of the service for which the _destination-ip_ applies. The _count_ modifier will affect the number of pings that are issued. The _interface_ modifier lets administrators specify the egress interface for issuing the pings. The _timeout_ modifier will set the waiting period for a reply before declaring the ping as a failure. The _set-df-bit_ and _record-route_ options enable the respective flags in the outgoing ICMP request.

#### Example

```
admin@gouda.novigrad# service-ping service-name Internet tenant lanSubnet source-ip 192.168.0.5 8.8.8.8
PING 8.8.8.8 56 bytes of data.
Ping from 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): icmp_seq=0 ttl=57 time=22.296ms
Ping from 8.8.8.8 (8.8.8.8): icmp_seq=1 ttl=57 time=11.303ms

## set context node

#### Usage

```
set context node <node>
```

##### Positional Arguments

- **node**    the name of the node

#### Description

The _set context node_ command puts the PCLI into a mode where every subsequent command that is issued that can take a node (in the case of a 128T router) as an argument will default to the context&#39;s values.

#### Version History

| Release | Modification             |
| ------- | -------------------------|
| 5.0.0   | This feature was removed |

## set context router

#### Usage

```
set context router <router>
```

##### Description

The _set context router_ command can be used to set the PCLI into a mode where every subsequent command that is issued that can take a router (in the case of the 128T Conductor) or a node (in the case of a 128T router) as an argument will default to the context&#39;s values.

:::note
This does _not_ "remote shell" into the router/node specified by the context&#39;s values, it merely uses these as default values for commands that (generally) display value. E.g., show stats, show flows, etc.
:::

When a context is set, the prompt changes to indicate the context as a parenthetical label at the beginning of each PCLI command.

Setting the context to a router is only available within the PCLI of a 128T Conductor.

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| router | The name of the router |

#### Example

```
admin@conductor1.labconductor# set context router beacon
(beacon) admin@conductor1.labconductor#
```

#### See Also

- [clear context node](#clear-context-node) Clear only the node context
- [clear context router](#clear-context-router) Clear both the router context and node context

## set context stats start-time

#### Usage

```
set context start-time [<start-time>]
```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| start-time | A timestamp string that can include date, time, or both. Special value "now" sets the start time point to the current time [type: timestamp or 'now'] (default: now) |

#### Description

_set context stats start-time_ lets administrators set a "zero time" for all statistics that the 128T has accumulated. While this _stats start-time_ context is set, all of the output for _show stats_ commands will reflect the accumulation of statistics since that time. This is very useful when troubleshooting issues, or after making configuration changes, to only show data relevant to the exercise at hand.

The _set context stats start-time_ has a flexible parser and can accept many different forms of "time" strings that include date information, time information, or both. There&#39;s also a keyword "now" that sets the _stats start-time_ to the current 128T system clock. (The "now" behavior is the default, and thus the 128T will set the _stats start-time_ to the current clock time when no argument is supplied.)

#### Example

```
admin@cnd1.conductor# set context stats start-time
Stats start time set to: 2018-02-07 10:41:58

admin@cnd1.conductor# set context stats start-time "December 25, 2017"
Stats start time set to: 2017-12-25 00:00:00
```

#### See Also

- [clear context node](#clear-context-node) Clear only the node context
- [clear context router](#clear-context-router) Clear both the router context and node context
- [set context router](#set-context-router) Set the context to a different router

#### Description

The _set log level_ command adjusts the degree to which the 128T router writes information into its log files. This is used to selectively turn up and down log verbosity for troubleshooting purposes.

The optional &lt;process-name&gt; and &lt;node-name&gt; arguments, can selectively change only a specific 128T router&#x27;s software process on a given node.

The _level_ must be one of: fatal, error, warning, info, debug, and trace. These are listed in order of increasing verbosity. 128 Technology, Inc. generally recommends that systems be set to _info_ level by default under normal operating circumstances.

As of software version 3.1, a new subcommand _set log level category_, allows administrators to collectively adjust groups of related functionality for specific troubleshooting exercises â€“ instead of blindly adjusting the entire system&#x27;s log level and potentially impacting performance.

The category can be any of the following:

| Category Name | Long Name | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ATCS | Analytics | Components related to the 128T Analytics Engine |
| PLAT | Platform | Components related to the underlying platform management. |
| RDB | Redundancy Database | The subsystem responsible for synchronizing data between nodes. |
| IPC | Interprocess Communications | The subsystem responsible for messaging between components within the 128T product. |
| DATA | Metadata Database | Components related to the configuration and state databases. |
| RTG | Routing | Components related to the routing engine. |

| FLC | &quot;FastLane Control&quot; | Control system for packet forwarding. |
| FPP | First Packet Processing | System for processing the initial packet of each new session. |
| DISC | Discovery | Discovery-based components (except BFD). Today this is DHCP and ARP. |
| LINK | Internode Link Detection | The subsystem for inter-node communication (today, BFD). |
| USER | User | User-created log messages, generated via the _write_ command. |

By specifying a specific peer (through the optional argument _&lt;neighbor-ip&gt;_), administrators can view state information about one peer at a time. When specifying a specific neighbor, the output may include the routes shared with that peer by appending _advertised-route_ or received from that peer by appending _received-routes_.

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show bgp neighbors
BGP neighbor is 172.18.1.2, remote AS 4200000001, local AS 4200000128, external
link
  BGP version 4, remote router ID 1.1.1.1
  BGP state = Established, up for 00:27:25
  Last read 00:00:25, hold time is 90, keepalive interval is 30 seconds
  Configured hold time is 90, keepalive interval is 30 seconds
  Neighbor capabilities:
    4 Byte AS: advertised and received
    Route refresh: advertised and received(old &amp; new)
    Address family IPv4 Unicast: advertised and received
    Graceful Restart Capabilty: advertised and received
      Remote Restart timer is 120 seconds
      Address families by peer:
        none

## `show bgp summary`

Show the current BGP summary from the routing manager.

#### Usage

```
show bgp summary [rows <rows>] [force] router <router> vrf <vrf-name>
```

##### Keyword Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| force | Skip confirmation prompt. Only required when targeting all routers |
| router | The name of the router for which to display the BGP summary |
| rows | The number of bgp entries to display at once [type: int or &#x27;all&#x27;] (default: 50) |

#### Description

The _show bgp summary_ gives administrators a high-level summary table of the state of all of the 128T router&#x27;s BGP peers.

It includes information on each BGP neighbor, including the version (V) of BGP that they are using (generally v4), the Autonomous System number (AS), the number of BGP messages sent and received (MsgSent, MsgRcvd), the table version (TblVer), etc.

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show bgp summary
BGP router identifier 128.128.128.128, local AS number 4200000128

## show config candidate

#### Usage

```
show config candidate [authority [router [ ...] ][verbose] [flat]
```

#### Description

This command returns the current candidate configuration on the 128T router (i.e., the configuration that is currently being edited, not the configuration that is actively running). The output from _show config candidate_ will only show fields and values within the configuration that are set to non-default values, for brevity.

The _show config candidate_ command has two optional flags: _verbose_ and _flat_. Adding the _verbose_ flag will show the entire configuration, including items that are part of the system&#39;s default configuration (normally hidden when using _show config candidate_ by itself). Adding the _flat_ flag will output the configuration as a series of individual, fully qualified configuration statements, which can singularly affect each component of the configuration discretely. That is, any of the lines can be used without any context to configure a single attribute, object, etc.

Note that the output from _show config candidate_ is formatted in such a way so as to allow the text to be cut and pasted into a CLI session to configure a separate 128T router.

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show config candidate
config
â€‹    authority
â€‹        router  Fabric128
â€‹            name  Fabric128
â€‹            node  labsystem1
â€‹                name              labsystem1
â€‹                id                1
â€‹                description       "Primary lab system"
â€‹                location          "Newton, MA"
â€‹                role              combo
â€‹                device-interface  1
â€‹                    id                 1
â€‹                    description        "external network"
â€‹                    type               ethernet
â€‹                    pci-address        0000:02:00.0
...
```
The same configuration using the _flat_ flag is displayed quite differently:
```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show config candidate flat
config authority router Fabric128 name  Fabric128
config authority router Fabric128 node labsystem1 name              labsystem1
config authority router Fabric128 node labsystem1 id                1
config authority router Fabric128 node labsystem1 description       "Primary lab system"
config authority router Fabric128 node labsystem1 location          "Newton, MA"
config authority router Fabric128 node labsystem1 role              combo
config authority router Fabric128 node labsystem1 device-interface 1 id                 1
config authority router Fabric128 node labsystem1 device-interface 1 description        "external network"
config authority router Fabric128 node labsystem1 device-interface 1 type               ethernet
config authority router Fabric128 node labsystem1 device-interface 1 pci-address        0000:02:00.0
```

The _show config candidate_ command also lets users show specific portions of the configuration by specifying the path to the areas of interest. For multiple instance items, such as _node_, _service_, etc., a keyword _all_ will display all items of the specified type:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show config candidate authority session-type verbose all
config
â€‹    authority
â€‹        session-type  HTTP
â€‹            name           HTTP
â€‹            service-class  Standard
â€‹            timeout        7200000
â€‹            transport      tcp
â€‹                protocol    tcp
â€‹                port-range  80
â€‹                    start-port  80
â€‹                exit
â€‹                port-range  8080
â€‹                    start-port  8080
â€‹                exit
â€‹            exit

## `show config locally-modified`

Display all routers with a locally modified config version

#### Usage

```
show config locally-modified
```

## `show config out-of-sync`

Display all routers with a config version that is out of sync with the conductor

#### Usage

```
show config out-of-sync
```

## show config running

#### Usage

```
show config running [authority [router [...] ][verbose] [flat]
```

#### Description

This command returns the current running configuration on the 128T router (i.e., the configuration that is active and processing traffic). The output from _show config running_ will only show fields and values within the configuration that are set to non-default values, for brevity.

The _show config running_ command has two optional flags: _verbose_ and _flat_. Adding the _verbose_ flag will show the entire configuration, including items that are part of the system&#39;s default configuration (normally hidden when using _show config running_ by itself). Adding the _flat_ flag will output the configuration as a series of individual, fully qualified configuration statements, which can singularly affect each component of the configuration discretely. That is, any of the lines can be used without any context to configure a single attribute, object, etc.

Note that the output from _show config running_ is formatted in such a way so as to allow the text to be cut and pasted into a CLI session to configure a separate 128T router.

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show config running

| [`show events config commit`](#show-events-config-commit) | Shows events related to running config change |
| [`show stats config`](#show-stats-config) | Metrics pertaining to the get-config RPC |

#### Description

This command displays the version number of the running configuration on the 128T router. This version number is auto-generated, and is the UNIX timestamp when the configuration is committed. (As a consequence, you should expect that successive commits to the same configuration will increment the version by more than one. This is a change in behavior from pre-2.0 software, which used a monotonically incrementing integer to represent the configuration version.)

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show config version
Fri 2017-02-24 09:34:43 EST
Version 1487780689 committed at: Wed 2017-02-22 11:24:49

| 2.0.0   | The behavior changed as described in the Description text above |
| 3.0.0   | Updated to display the timestamp of the configuration change in human readable form |

## show context stats start-time

#### Usage

```
show context stats start-time
```

#### Description

The _show context stats start-time_ subcommand shows the _stats start-time_ (if set), or indicates that there is no start-time currently set. For more information on setting _stats start-time_, please refer to _set context_ in this manual.

#### Example

```

#### Version History

| Release | Modification                |
| ------- | ----------------------------|
| 1.0.0   | This feature was introduced |
| 3.0.0   | Added _node_ keyword to enforce PCLI consistency |
| 5.1.0   | Added VFR support, next hop details and the ability to filter by: service-name, hierarchy-service-name, contains-service-name, prefix, source-address, source-interface, and tenant. |


## `show history`

Show PCLI command history for the current user.

#### Usage

```
show history [rows <rows>]
```

##### Keyword Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| rows | The number of recent commands to show [type: int or &#x27;all&#x27;] |

##### See Also

| command | description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| [`clear history`](#clear-history) | Clear the PCLI&#x27;s command history for this user. |

#### Example

```
admin@gouda.novigrad# show history
   1   show run
   2   show config running
   3   quit
   4   shell

...

 465   show ntp
 466   show network-interface
 467   show network-interface wan-interface

 469   show network-interface application
 470   show history
```

## `show load-balancer`

Shows current load balancer agent entries from the highway manager at the specified node.

#### Usage

```
show load-balancer [service <service>] [agent <agent>] [force] [node <node>] router <router>
```

##### Keyword Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| agent | Agent name to show. If unspecified, shows all agents. |
| force | Skip confirmation prompt. Only required when targeting all routers |
| node | The name of the node |
| router | The name of the router |
| service | Service name to show. If unspecified, shows all services. |

#### Description

The _show load-balancer_ command provides feedback on the 128T router&#x27;s load balancing behavior, when configured to balance traffic (via a service-policy).

This command, when issued without any filters (agent, node, or service) will display all agents, nodes, and services that are subject to load balancing. (The output can be quite verbose.) These filters may be combined to &quot;hone in&quot; on specific agents/nodes/services selectively.

This command is extremely helpful for identifying why the 128T router selected specific destinations for its session-oriented traffic.

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show load-balancer

## `show peers`

Display peer information.

#### Usage

```
show peers [name <name>] [force] router <router> [<verbosity>]
```

##### Keyword Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| force | Skip confirmation prompt. Only required when targeting all routers |
| name | Peer to display (default: all) |
| router | The router on which to display peers |

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| verbosity | detail \| summary (default: summary) |

##### Subcommands

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| hostnames | Display resolved hostnames of peers |

#### Description

The _show peers_ command displays properties of each of the &quot;neighboring&quot; 128T routers that the router in question has a peering association with.

This command shows information on peering associations between 128T routers, not peering associations with BGP peers. For information on BGP peering statistics, refer to &quot;show bgp&quot; in this document.

For each peer it shows which interface the peer is reachable via, the destination IP address for which the peer is reached, the VLAN to use to reach it, and whether the peer is currently &quot;up&quot;, &quot;down&quot;, or &quot;initializing&quot;.

#### Example

## `show service-path`

Displays service path information at the specified node.

#### Usage

```
show service-path [{service-name <name> | hierarchy-service-name <name> | contains-service-name <name>}] [{rows <rows> | detail}] router <router> node <node>
```

##### Keyword Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| contains-service-name | The partial substring match for which to display the service path |
| detail | Display detail info of service path |
| hierarchy-service-name | The hierarchy root for which to display the service path |
| node | The node for which to display service path |
| router | The router for which to display the service path |
| rows | The number of service paths to display at once [type: int or &#x27;all&#x27;] (default: 50) |
| service-name | The exact service name for which to display the service path |

#### Description

The `show service-path` command displays active service paths passing through the 128T router. This simplifies troubleshooting, allowing you to determine where sessions belonging to a particular service would egress. Multiple service filters allow you to target a specific service or services. Output can be displayed as a summary or in a detail view with pagination support. When using the `detail` argument, in-path metrics are managed by the performance monitor when enabled. If the performance monitor is not enabled, the local metrics generated by BFD are used.

##### Subcommands

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| by-id| &lt;session-id&gt; |
| top | &lt;bandwidth&gt; |

#### Description

The _show sessions_ command displays active sessions passing through the 128T router. The output from the command shows the sessions internal ID (useful for searching through log files), the service, tenant, and source/destination IP information for each active session. Additionally, you can specify the node using the optional _node-name_ argument, and the session-id using the _by-id_ subcommand. 

The NAT IP and Port fields will be populated whenever a session is subject to source NAT (see _source-nat_ later in this reference guide for more information). It also shows the timeout value that will cause the session to expire if it remains idle for that number of seconds.

Various services and tenants may display with surrounding braces to indicate that these are internally-generated services and tenants. These internal services and tenants are created when peering between adjacent nodes, establishing BGP sessions, BFD sessions, etc.

:::info
The contents of the table will vary based upon the software version in use. This applies when, for example, a conductor running a new software version requests session table data from routers running older software versions.

## `show udp-transform`

Display the status of UDP transform between peers.

#### Usage

```
show udp-transform [force] [node <node>] router <router>
```

##### Keyword Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| force | Skip confirmation prompt. Only required when targeting all routers |
| node | The node for which to display transform status |
| router | The router for which to display transform status |

#### Description

A 128T router may need to transform TCP packets into UDP packets to enable SVR to traverse stateful firewalls. By default, the 128T router runs a [firewall detector](concepts_machine_communication.md#firewall-detector) process over peer paths, and will dynamically enable UDP transform when necessary. (Administrators may also elect to enable UDP transform if they know there are stateful firewalls in the path.) This command shows whether a path has UDP transform enabled, and if so, which firewall detection tests triggered the feature to be enabled.

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show udp-transform router newton
============= ============ ============ ========== =========================================
 Router Name   Node Name    Peer         Status     Reason(s)
============= ============ ============ ========== =========================================
 newton        labsystem2   becket       enabled    TCP SYN; Mid-flow; TCP SYN Jumbo;
                            becket       enabled    TCP SYN; TCP SYN Jumbo;
                            burlington   enabled    TCP SYN; Mid-flow; TCP SYN Jumbo;
```

## `show user`

#### Usage

```
show user [<username>]
```

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| username | the name of the account to display (default: &lt;current user&gt;) |

##### See Also

| command | description |

| [`restore users factory-default`](#restore-users-factory-default) | Restore the user configuration to factory defaults. |
| [`set password`](#set-password) | Change your password. |

#### Description

The _show user_ subcommand displays the attributes for the specified user account (i.e., whether the account is enabled, the user&#x27;s full name, and their role).

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show user jdeveloper

=============================
 Information for jdeveloper:
=============================
 Enabled: true
 Full Name: Joe Developer
 Role: admin

admin@labsystem1.fiedler#
```
If the 128T is configured to obtain user accounts from LDAP, the connectivity status of the LDAP server is displayed at the end of the output.
```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show user all

============== ====================== ======= =============== =========
 Username       Full Name              Roles   Features        Enabled

## top

#### Usage

```
top
```

#### Description
This command sets the focus of the PCLI prompt to the top level of the PCLI&#39;s hierarchy. It is used while in configuration mode to "jump" up out and back to the baseline prompt. It is only available within configuration mode.

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# config authority router burlington
admin@labsystem1.fiedler (router[name=burlington])# node combo1
admin@labsystem1.fiedler (node[name=combo1])# where
config authority router burlington node combo1

#### Description

This command moves the administrative focus of the PCLI "up" the specified number of levels. When the optional &lt;levels&gt; argument is left off, it moves the focus up one level.

:::note
This command is only available while in configuration mode.
:::

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# config authority router burlington
admin@labsystem1.fiedler (router[name=burlington])# node combo1
admin@labsystem1.fiedler (node[name=combo1])# device-interface 11
admin@labsystem1.fiedler (device-interface[id=11])# network-interface ext11

## `validate`

Validate the candidate config.

#### Usage

```
validate [router <router>]
```

##### Keyword Arguments

| name | description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| router | The name of the router (default: all) |

#### Description

This command validates the current candidate configuration to check for referential integrity among the various configuration objects, to check for the use of deprecated configuration elements, and to supply warnings when various configuration elements cannot be validated.

Many configuration elements within the 128T router refer to other configuration elements by their _name_. If an administrator mistypes a name, or a referenced object is deleted without updating the source of that reference, this candidate configuration is said to be invalid. By using the validate command, administrators can ensure their configuration is valid prior to committing it to be the running configuration.

:::note
validation occurs automatically whenever the commit command is run; this standalone
command allows administrators to check for validity without requiring that the
configuration is committed immediately.
:::

The `validate` command provides warnings when a configuration contains deprecated elements - elements that are scheduled for removal in a future release of the 128T software. This is to give administrators the opportunity to replace the impacted configuration stanzas with their replacement.

The `validate` command will also provide warnings when a configuration cannot be validated and requires administrative oversight.

When validation fails, the administrator is notified via output to the CLI. The output from the `validate` command will identify the configuration that is failing validation.

#### Example

```
admin@node1.bernstein# validate
âœ– Validating...
% Error: Candidate configuration is invalid:
1. inter-node-security is required
reported by router 'bernstein'

    config
        authority
            router datacenter
```

## `where`

Display the current location in the CLI hierarchy.

#### Usage

```
where
```

#### Description

This command returns the user&#x27;s current position within the CLI hierarchy. When executed from the main CLI prompt, it returns nothing. When executed from within the configuration tree, it returns the user&#x27;s current position within the tree.

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# where
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# conf auth router newton
admin@labsystem1.fiedler (router[name=newton])# where
configure authority router newton
admin@labsystem1.fiedler (router[name=newton])#
```

| ---- | ----------- |
| force | Skip confirmation prompt. Only required when targeting all routers |
| node | The node on which to log |
| router | The router on which to log (default: &lt;current router&gt;) |

##### Positional Arguments

| name | description |

| [`set log level`](#set-log-level) | Set the log level of a process. |
| [`write log snapshot`](#write-log-snapshot) | Write a snapshot to the log. |

#### Description

The `write log message` command lets administrators write messages into log files; this is typically used as a marker during troubleshooting exercises, to insert a string that can later be located to reference the onset of a test.

#### Example

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# write log message "---- starting test here ----"
Log message successfully written
admin@labsystem1.fiedler#
```

This message will appear in the log files with the category type "USER", as is demonstrated here:

```
[admin@labsystem1 ~]$ tail -n 5 /var/log/128technology/stateMonitor.log
  "message" : "No connectivity to labsystem5.burlington",
  "value" : "2"
}}

## show stats
<!-- Not updated to 4.3+ -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats [since [ <timestamp> | launch] ] [<verbosity>] ...
```

#### Description

The _show stats_ command, and its myriad of subcommands, retrieve statistical data from various functions within the 128T router and return them to the user. Used for troubleshooting, debugging configuration, or just to monitor the health and well-being of the 128T router, these show commands provide a wealth of information and insight to users of the software.

Below is a representative sample of one of the _show stats_ commands.

:::note
The number and types of columns displayed may vary from software release to software release, as new statistics become available.

:::note
In this example the _Port_ value of 255 represents packets that are being sent to the CPU on the receiving 128T for additional processing â€“ namely, the first packet of a new session. Many of the _show stats_ commands will reference port 255, and in all cases this value 255 represents an "internal" port created by the 128T router for interprocess communication purposes.
:::

Each table of output can be displayed in three different modes of verbosity: debug, detail, and summary. The default is _detail_, which consolidates all traffic from various CPU cores that have been allocated to packet processing into a single value.

The value _debug_ shows a breakdown of all statistics into their most granular constituent components. For the access-policy-table, this will show how many access-policy-table hits have occurred by CPU core.

As of software version 3.1, the _show stats_ command provides an additional feature, the ability to set a "zero point" for displaying statistical output using the _since_ command. The _since_ command takes either a timestamp as its argument (in ISO 8601 format), or the keyword _launch_, which shows statistics accumulated since the 128T routing software was launched. For more information on the zero point, refer to the section of this guide on _set context stats_.

Generally speaking, the statistical data available via the 128T router&#39;s PCLI is organized into a tree-like hierarchy, with each subcommand having (potentially) its own series of subcommands. By omitting the (optional) subcommands, the 128T router will summarize all data from all possible subcommands and present it in a summary table (this is new behavior as of our 1.1 software release); while this is very convenient to show a lot of potential data at a glance, it does incur additional processing overhead, and the retrieval of statistics may take an inordinately long time.

Each of the various _show stats_ subcommands will be described in sections that follow.

The _show stats aggregate-session_ command and its various subcommands show aggregate data about session traffic traversing the 128T router, through a variety of different aggregation lenses. Each of the subcommands lets users show different "cuts" of the session data; e.g., the _by-service-route_ subcommand will show all traffic associated with the configured service-route elements on a given system.

Each of the subcommands includes the following data:

| Data Specifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| bandwidth | The amount of bandwidth in bytes/second. |
| rx-data | The amount of data received in bytes. |
| rx-packets | The number of packets received. |
| rx-tcp-data | The amount of data received over TCP. |
| rx-tcp-packets | The number of TCP packets received. |
| rx-tcp-retransmissions | The number of duplicate TCP packets received. |
| rx-udp-data | The amount of data received over UDP. |
| rx-udp-packets | The number of UDP packets received. |
| session-arrival-rate | The arrival rate (in new sessions per second) for traffic. |
| session-count | The number of active sessions. |
| session-departure-rate | The number of sessions terminated per second. |
| total-data | The total amount of data for all sessions. |
| total-packets | The total number of packets received and sent. |
| total-tcp-data | The total amount of data received and sent over TCP. |
| total-tcp-packets | The total number of TCP packets sent and received. |
| total-tcp-retransmissions | The total number of TCP retransmissions sent and received. |
| total-udp-data | The total amount of data received and sent over UDP. |
| total-udp-packets | The total number of UDP packets sent and received over UDP. |
| tx-data | The total amount of data transmitted. |
| tx-packets | The total number of packets transmitted. |
| tx-tcp-data | The total amount of data transmitted over TCP. |
| tx-tcp-packets | The total number of packets transmitted over TCP. |
| tx-tcp-retransmissions | The total number of TCP retranmissions sent. |
| tx-udp-data | The total amount of UDP data sent. |
| tx-udp-packets | The total number of packets sent using UDP. |

Within each of the various lenses, the output can be filtered down to an constituent element of that type; for example, the _show stats aggregate-session by-device-interface_ can filter the output to display the statistics for a single device-interface. This is done _after_ the data specifier, as follows:

```
user@labsystem1.fiedler> show stats aggregate-session by-device-interface bandwidth device-interface labsystem1.10
Fri 2017-07-21 14:51:56 EDT

## show stats arp
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats arp [{ encapsulation | entries | queued | received | sent }] [node <node-name>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

The _show stats arp_ command has a variety of subcommands to display statistical information on various aspects of the 128T router&#39;s handling of sent and received ARP messages. Each of those will be described in the sections that follow.

Omitting the subcommand will cause the 128T router to aggregate statistics from all of the subcommands and present them in tabular view; as there are a lot of subcommands, this command may take a very long time to accumulate â€“ particularly on a busy system.

## show stats arp encapsulation
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats arp encapsulation sent [{ failure | success }] [node <node-name>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

The _show stats arp encapsulation_ command has a variety of command-line modifiers that show statistics related to the transmission of Layer 2 encapsulation of IP packets.

When no subcommand is specified, the 128T router will return statistics on all subcommands and present them in a summary table:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show stats arp encapsulation sent
Wed 2016-11-02 09:23:23 EDT
Retrieving statistics...

## show stats arp queued
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats arp queued [{ failure { drop | queue-full } | packets }] [node <node-name>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

The _show stats arp queued_ command has three modes, depending on the command line arguments used when it is invoked. The two failure modes (drop and queue full) will display counts for the number of packets that are dropped due to the failure to receive a response to an ARP request issued by the 128T router, and the number of packets that failed to enqueue due to a failed ARP request, respectively.

The _show stats arp queued packets_ command shows the number of packets waiting in queues for a pending ARP transation.

All three of these commands will display tabular data such as the following:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show stats arp queued failure queue-full
Retrieving statistics...

The number of packets that failed to enqueue
--------------------------------------------
=============  =======

```
show stats arp received [{ arp-reply | arp-request | errors { arp-reply | arp-request | neighbor-advertisement | neighbor-solicit | processing | unknown-type } | neighbor-advertisement | neighbor-solicit }] [node <node-name>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

The _show stats arp received_ command has a variety of command line modifiers to show various sets of statistics regarding the ARP traffic that this system has received. The _arp-reply_ and _arp-request_ modifiers show the number of ARP replies and requests that the 128T router has received, respectively. Each of these commands outputs its data in a table that looks like the following:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show stats arp received arp-reply
Retrieving statistics...

The number of ARP replies received
----------------------------------
=============  =======
Node             Value
=============  =======
linecard-test        0
=============  =======
```

The _show stats arp received errors_ command has a list of modifiers to allow users to see the statistics regarding to the number of invalid or ignored ARP/ICMPv6 packets in various forms. These statistics are particularly useful during troubleshooting exercises; large numbers of ARP receive errors may be emblematic of larger network issues.

The ARP reply and ARP request modifiers show statistics related to the number of errors related to the receipt of ARP replies and requests. The neighbor-advertisement and neighbor-solicit modifiers show errors related to the receipt of ICMPv6 errors. When the 128T router has difficulties with processing ARP or ICMPv6 packets, they will increment the values in the _processing_ table. Unclassified (or unclassifiable) ARP/ICMPv6 packets received will increment the values in the _unknown-type_ table.

All of the modifiers (arp-reply, arp-request, neighbor-advertisement, neighbor-solicit, processing, unknown-type) show their data in a similar format:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show stats arp received errors unknown-type
Retrieving statistics...

The number of Packets received of an unknown type
-------------------------------------------------
=============  =======
Node             Value
=============  =======
linecard-test        0
=============  =======
```

The _show stats arp received neighbor-advertisement_ and _neighbor-solicit_ modifiers are used to show statistics regarding the number of ICMPv6 packets received. Note that at this time the 128T router can classify ICMPv6 packets, even in the absence of full IPv6 support.

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show stats arp received neighbor-advertisement
Retrieving statistics...

The number of ICMPv6 Neighbor Advertisements received
-----------------------------------------------------
=============  =======
Node             Value

```

#### Description

The _show stats arp sent_ command has two modes: success and failure. Each of these modes shows tabular data relating to successful or failed ARP events, and outputs its counters in tabular format such as the following:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show stats arp sent success arp-reply
Retrieving statistics...

The number of ARP replies sent
------------------------------
=============  =======
Node             Value
=============  =======
linecard-test        0
=============  =======
```

The _success_ modifier tallies the number of ARP transmission events for requests, replies, and gratuitous ARPs. The _failure_ modifier increments when various ARP transmission events occur; _allocation_ shows the number of allocation failures when the 128T router fails to send an ARP packet, _arp-request_ and _arp-reply_ show the number of errors when sending requests and replies, and _gratuitous-arp_ shows the number of failed gratuitous ARP transmission attempts. The various modifiers associated with ICMPv6 are not in use at this time.

#### Description

The _show stats bfd neighbor_ counts the number of times that a neighbor has had a failover (a switchover where a pair of devices has exchanged active control of packet processing) or a NAT address has changed, as detected by BFD.

```

Generally speaking, devices behind dynamic NATs will be accessible via a specific IP:port in perpetuity as long as the port is refreshed frequently enough to keep that NAT&#39;s binding alive. However, NATs can be rebooted and pinholes can close; this statistic will let you know if the 128T router detected its neighbor has changed NAT ports over time.

#### Syntax

```
show stats bfd received invalid { authentication-field | detect-multiple | discriminator | header-large | header-small | header-version | length-packets | packets | payload-small } [node <node-name>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

The _show stats bfd received invalid_ command, with its modifiers, shows the administrator the count for all BFD packets that were deemed invalid, broken down into categories for which the 128T router failed to handle them. The _authentication-field_ modifier counts the number of BFD packets that had an invalid authorization field, the _detect-multiple_ packets had an invalid multiplier value, and the _discriminator_ had an invalid discriminator. The various _header-_ modifiers count whether or not the header of the BFD packet was too large, too small, or had the wrong version information within it. The _length-packets_ modifier counts the number of packets marked invalid due to an incorrect length. Packets that arrive under the minimum size threshold for BFD packets are invalidated and shown in the _payload-small_ counter. The total of all invalid packets is captured in the table shown by the _packets_ modifier.

All of the modifiers will display a table similar to the following:

```

## show stats external-protocols
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats external-protocols [{ agent | manager } [ { channel-messages | errors | packets }] [node <node>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

Each 128T router has a set of processes known as the _External Protocol Manager_ (EPM) and _External Protocol Agent_ (EPA) that communicate with each other to report on various types of environmental issues. The _show stats external-protocols_ tables represent a breakdown of the different types of messaging that the EPM and EPA exchange. The table can be broken down further into the EPM statistics (with the optional argument _manager_, or the EPA statistics with the optional argument _agent_.

This command is usually only run at the request of 128 Technology&#39;s support organization to diagnose a specific problem.

## show stats ipfix
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats ipfix [record-export-rate | time-per-export | time-per-session | total-generation-time | total-records] [node <node-name>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

The _show stats ipfix_ command shows information about the 128T router&#39;s IPFIX (IP Flow Information eXport) record generation and export feature.

The output shows a number of IPFIX stats; the _record-export-rate_ is the number of IPFIX records exported per second.  The values for _time-per-session_ and _time-per-export_, both expressed in microseconds, represent the average time spent by the 128T system to generate and export IPFIX records, respectively. The _total-generation-time_, also expressed in microseconds, represents the amount of time spent generating IPFIX records since the system was started. Lastly, the _total-records_ is a counter of the number of IPFIX records generated in total.

## show stats packet-capture
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats packet-capture { success | write-failure } [core <core>] [node <node>] [port <port>]
```

#### Description

The _show stats packet-capture_ commands display information about any ongoing packet capture activity that an administrator has initiated. The _success_ statistics show the number of packets that have been captured to date, the _write-failure_ statistics show the number of packets that failed to be written to a file (likely due to disk space issues).

Both the _success_ and _write-failure_ modifiers show their information in the standard, tabular format:

```
admin@labsystem1.fiedler# show stats packet-capture success

## show stats packet-processing action
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats packet-processing action [{ failure | success }]
```

#### Description

The _show stats packet-processing-action_ command displays information for the various flow actions within the 128T router. Each flow, as it is instantiated by the 128T router, may have various "actions" associated with it based upon either the nature of the traffic, the configuration of the 128T router, or both.

The subcommands associated with packet-processing-action are grouped into success conditions and failure conditions, then broken down by action type, each one showing tabular data for the notable events associated with that flow action.

The various sections that follow illustrate all of the _show stats packet-processing action_ subcommands.

<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats packet-processing action failure [{ aes | bfd | ethernet-header-transform | hmac | metadata | rate-limit-check | tcp-state | ttl-validate }]
```

#### Description

The _show stats packet-processing-action failure_ command enumerates all of the different failure cases for action processing within the 128T router. As mentioned earlier, _actions_ are applied to packets received, and can perform a wide variety of functions: encryption, transformations, rate limiting, TCP state machine validation, etc. When these actions are applied to a packet and that action fails, the stats within this table are incremented.

| Action Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| aes | These actions are related to the encryption and/or decryption of packets. |
| bfd | The BFD actions (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) are associated with the inter-node and/or inter-router BFD exchanges that 128T routers use to determine health, aliveness, and utilization. |
| ethernet-header-transform | Ethernet headers are transformed (rewritten) as packets are sent to next hop gateways or hosts. (The source and destination MAC addresses.) |
| hmac | HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is used to authenticate that the sender of a message is who it says that it is. 128T routers optionally use HMAC to authenticate one another â€“ essentially "signing" packets to validate the authenticity of the source. |
| ip-header-transform | IP headers are transformed to change one protocol into another; notably, ICMP is transformed to UDP when sent via SVR to another 128T peer. |
| metadata | 128T routers use metadata to exchange state with one another. The insertion and removal of metadata are common actions at the outset of a new session. |
| rate-limit-check | Rate limiting (in bytes per second) is a flow-based action. |
| tcp-state | The 128T router will "follow" the TCP state machine for TCP-based flows (ensuring that the three-way handshake is completed within a set amount of time, for example). Checking the validity of the TCP state is a flow action. |
| ttl-validate | TTL (Time To Live) validation is used within IP networks as a last resort for loop prevention. |

| Action Category | Description |
| --- | --- |
| aes | These actions are related to the encryption and/or decryption of packets. |
| bfd | The BFD actions (Bidirectional Forwarding Detection) are associated with the inter-node and/or inter-router BFD exchanges that 128T routers use to determine health, aliveness, and utilization. |
| detour | The detour action diverts packets from the "fast lane" (switching fabric) to the control path for further processing. |
| dpi | DPI, or Deep Packet Inspection, is used to peer into the payload of a packet for various patterns to perform more granular classification. |
| drop | As its name implies, this action causes a packet to be dropped. |
| ethernet-header-transform | Ethernet headers are transformed (rewritten) as packets are sent to next hop gateways or hosts. (The source and destination MAC addresses.) |
| forward | This action is used to indicate that a packet should be forwarded out of the 128T router and onto its next hop. |
| hmac | HMAC (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is used to authenticate that the sender of a message is who it says that it is. 128T routers optionally use HMAC to authenticate one another â€“ essentially "signing" packets to validate the authenticity of the source. |
| ip-header-transform | IP headers are transformed to change one protocol into another; notably, ICMP is transformed to UDP when sent via SVR to another 128T peer. |
| metadata | 128T routers use metadata to exchange state with one another. The insertion and removal of metadata are common actions at the outset of a new session. |
| rate-limit-check | Rate limiting (in bytes per second) is a flow-based action. |
| tcp-state | The 128T router will "follow" the TCP state machine for TCP-based flows (ensuring that the three-way handshake is completed within a set amount of time, for example). Checking the validity of the TCP state is a flow action. |
| ttl-validate | TTL (Time To Live) validation is used within IP networks as a last resort for loop prevention. |

## show stats packet-processing classifier
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats packet-processing classifier [{ received ... | sent ... }] [node <node>] [port <port>]
```

#### Description

As packets are received by a 128T router, an initial classification is done to determine further treatment and processing. Most basic Layer 2 through Layer 4 types are classified and categorized, and reflected in the _show stats packet-processing classifier received_ tables.

The _show stats packet-processing classifier sent_ tables likewise return statistics regarding the number of packets of various L2-L4 types that the 128T router transmits.

The _received_ and _sent_ options are enumerated in the sections that follow.

Both the _received_ and _sent_ options are displayed in tabular format that breaks down the quantities by node and device port; the output for these tables may optionally be filtered to specific nodes and/or device ports by supplying them as arguments to the command line.

## show stats packet-processing enqueue
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats packet-processing enqueue ... [node <node >] [port <port>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

This command displays information about the various queues within the 128T router&#39;s traffic management and packet processing subsystems. At various points in a packet&#39;s lifecycle through the 128T router it is enqueued for processing; the subcommands associated with _show stats packet-processing enqueue_ give tallies for the successful, and unsuccessful enqueue events.

Generally speaking, the various failure modes listed below are typically incremented when a queue is full â€“ not draining as fast as packets are arriving. This is usually due to an unexpected flood of inbound packets.

The various subcommands are listed below:

| Subcommand | Description |
| --- | --- |
| to-controller-failure | This statistic counts the number of failure events when a control packet is unable to be enqueued when destined for the "fast lane controller". (Generally, the first packet of a new session.) |
| to-controller-success | This counts the number of successfully enqueued packets destined for the fast lane controller. |
| to-deferred-ring-failure | This statistic counts the number of failure events when a packet is unable to be enqueued when destined for the traffic engineering subsystem (e.g., for scheduling). |
| to-deferred-ring-success | This counts the number of successfully enqueued packets destined for the traffic engineering subsystem. |
| to-worker-core-failure | This statistic counts the number of failure events when a packet is unable to be enqueued back into the fast lane from the controller (generally, the first packet of a new session that has been processed by the controller). |
| to-worker-core-success | This counts the number of successfully enqueued packets destined for egress processing. |

A representative sample command is given here:

## show stats packet-processing fib-action
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats packet-processing fib-action ... [node <node>] [port <port>] [ <verbosity>]
```

#### Description

FIB entries in the 128T router may have associated "actions", which affect the packet&#39;s processing logic upon entry into the router. (Note: FIB lookups happen logically later than flow table lookups; for statistics related to flow table action events, refer to the section on _show stats packet-processing flow-action_).

The _show stats packet-processing fib-action_ table shows success, failure, and exception events (counters). More detail on success and failure events can be seen in the output from _show stats packet-processing action_. When the action processing has an exception, this means an internal error has occurred in attempting the action processing.

## show stats packet-processing fragmentation received
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats packet-processing fragmentation received [{ duplicate-first-fragment | duplicate-last-fragment | failure-to-reassemble | fragment-chains-discarded | fragment-chains-exceeded | fragment-chains-timeout | incomplete-fragments | invalid-length-first-fragment | successfully-reassembled }] [node <node>] [port <port>]
```

#### Description

Fragmented IP packets, as the name implies, are large packets split into smaller pieces prior to delivery. The fragments may arrive in any order, and must be reassembled by the recipient. If any of the fragments fail to arrive, the remaining fragments are of no value and are discarded. The _show stats packet-processing fragmentation received_ statistics categorize different observed behaviors (one success case and several failure cases) with fragmented packets and increment statistics accordingly.

The _duplicate-first-fragment_ and _duplicate-last-fragment_ modifiers increment when the particular fragment arrives twice. The _failure-to-reassemble_ increments when the 128T router cannot reassemble all of the fragments (usually due to missing fragments).

Fragments are reassembled in what are called "fragment chains". There are three statistics specific to the fragment chains: _fragment-chains-discarded_ counts the number of times a fragment chain is discarded due to an error (not receiving all fragments, errored fragments, etc.); _fragment-chains-exceeded_ is incremented when the 128T router does not have any available fragment chains to queue packets for reassembly; _fragment-chain-timeout_ is when a fragment chain does not receive all fragments for a given reassembly job within ten (10) seconds.

The _incomplete-fragments_ modifier shows the number of reassembly jobs that were missing fragments. The _invalid-length-first-fragment_ modifier increments when a fragment arrives with a misadvertised length.

The _successfully-reassembled_ modifier shows the number of fragment chains that have collected all fragments and completed reassembly with no errors.

All of the commands within _show stats packet-processing fragmentation_ display their information similarly; one such example is below. The output may optionally be filtered by data node and/or port by adding the appropriate modifiers.

## show stats packet-processing fragmentation sent
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats packet-processing fragmentation sent { fragmentation-creation-failure | ipv4-dont-fragment-drop | ipv4-fabric-fragments | ipv4-non-fabric-fragments | ipv4-packets-fragmented | ipv6-fabric-fragments | ipv6-mtu-exceeded-drop | ipv6-packets-fragmented | unknown-l2-version } [node <node>] [port <port>]
```

#### Description

The complement to the _receive_ statistics are the _show stats fragmentation sent_ statistics, which account for all of the packets that the 128T router performs fragmentation on.

The _fragmentation-creation-failure_ counts all instances where the 128T router cannot fragment a packet (internal error). The _ipv4-dont-fragment-drop_ counts all packets dropped because they exceed the path MTU and have the "don&#39;t fragment" bit set (hence the 128T router cannot fragment it). The _ipv4-packets-fragmented_ and _ipv6-packets-fragmented_ counters are a running total of the number of packets (not fragments) that have been fragmented. The _ipv4-fabric-fragments_ and _ipv6-fabric-fragments_ counters are a running total of the number of fragmented packets sent over a "fabric" link (i.e., using Secure Vector Routing) between 128T routers. The _unknown-l2-version_ counts the number of jumbo packets with an unknown (and therefore unhandled) L2 type.

All of the commands within _show stats packet-processing fragmentation_ display their information similarly; one such example is below. The output may optionally be filtered by data node and/or port by adding the appropriate modifiers.

## show stats packet-processing lookup fib-table
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats packet-processing lookup fib-table ... [node <node>] [core <core>] [port <port>]
```

#### Description

Each packet-forwarding component of the 128T router maintains a Forwarding Information Base (FIB) that includes rules for packet processing. When packets arrive that do not match an established flow, the system performs a FIB query to determine their disposition. This table records those events; the _hit_ table is when a match is found, the _miss_ table contains a tally of the times when no match was found.

## show stats packet-processing lookup tenant-table
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats packet-processing lookup tenant-table ... [node <node>] [core <core>] [port <port>]
```

#### Description

The 128T router&#39;s tenant lookup table is used to ascribe inbound packets to configured _tenants_. The resultant of the lookup is used in a subsequent lookup, the tenant-specific FIB lookup, to decide on the disposition for that packet.

Entries into the tenant table are populated by configuration on the 128T router. Each _interface_ contributes to the source lookup table, with its assigned tenant (or the "global tenant" in the absence of an assigned tenant). Each service-route will create an entry in the tenant table, assigned to the tenant of the service that agent belongs to. Also, each waypoint (for internode "router" traffic) creates an entry into the table.

The _hit_ modifier shows the normal (success) case, when a tenant is found in the lookup. The _miss_ modifier shows the failure case, when no tenant can be found; in this case, the packet will be tallied and dropped. The _lock-failure_ modifier increments when a lookup fails because the fast lane cannot obtain exclusive access to the source lookup table.

#### Description

Control packets are used within the 128T router to communicate between various software processes. The _show stats packet-processing received control-success_ statistics are incremented when control packets are sent between the fast lane and the Highway Manager process. This occurs when events such as adding an interface occurs, or when AES encryption is enabled or disabled. This command is generally only run at the direct request of 128 Technology&#39;s support team, when troubleshooting a reported issue.

## show stats redundancy port-initialization
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats redundancy port-initialization [{ marker-query-pending | marker-record-found | marker-record-not-found | marker-record-read-error | marker-record-write | pending-queries }] [node <node>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

The _show stats redundancy port-initialization_ tables show statistics related to allocation of "port blocks" from the redundancy database. Various functions on the 128T router require allocation of specific IP:port tuples (e.g., source NAT and waypoint flows) choose ports to uniquely identify sessions as they traverse the node(s). These ports must be preserved during failover, and a newly active system must not inadvertently choose a port selected by a system that had relinquished the active role (i.e., cause what is called a "collision"). The behaviors of the mechanism for ensuring port continuity and uniqueness is reflected in this table.

These commands are typically only run at the request of 128 Technology&#39;s support team, and to diagnose specific network conditions. This information, when combined with 128T log output, will help the support team to isolate network anomalies.

| Subcommand | Description |
| --- | --- |
| marker-query-pending | At boot or after one of its interfaces has become active, a 128T router will issue a "marker query" to the redundancy database for each interface. This meter reflects the number of outstanding queries that have not yet received a reply. This value should typically be zero (0). |
| marker-record-found | This increments when a request for a marker record results in a match. (Generally at failover or restart.) |
| marker-record-not-found | This increments when a request for a marker record finds no match. (Generally at cold boot.) |
| marker-record-read-error | This value increments when a system cannot read the marker record from the database. This is |
| marker-record-write | This indicates the number of marker records tht a 128T router sets in the redundancy database after querying for an existing marker record and not finding one. This typically happens only during initial boot or when a system needs to grow the port range it has in use. |
| pending-queries | This meter will increment during boot, and is generally caused by the timing of the various 128T routing processes starting up (i.e., the database queries are attempted before the database is finished initialization or the communication to it is not yet available). During normal operation this should be zero (0). |

## show stats redundancy port-list-records
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats redundancy port-list-records [{ list-record-pop-errors | list-record-pop-failures | list-record-pop-pending | list-record-pop-success | list-record-push }] [node <node>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

The _show stats redundancy port-list_ tables show statistics related to allocation of "blocks" of ports for 128T applications that require unique ports per use â€“ things such as source NAT and waypoint-to-waypoint communication.

The 128T router will request a block of free ports using a "pop" operation from the redundancy database, use those until they&#39;re (mostly) consumed, until it requests another. Meanwhile as it frees ports from previous allocations as sessions are torn down or expire, it aggregates a block of these ports and will "push" it back onto the database for later use. (This manifests as a _least recently used_, or LRU, algorithm, where ports that are freed wind up at the back of the line for subsequent reuse.)

These commands are typically only run at the request of 128 Technology&#39;s support team, and to diagnose specific network conditions. This information, when combined with 128T log output, will help the support team to isolate network anomalies.

| Subcommand | Description |
| --- | --- |
| list-record-pop-errors | This indicates the number of errors that occurred when attempting to retrieve a block of free ports from the redundancy database because the database was unreachable. |
| list-record-pop-failures | This indicates the number of failures when attempting to retrieve a block of free ports from the redundancy database because no free blocks were available. |
| list-record-pop-pending | This indicates the number pending requests that have neither succeeded nor failed, but are still being processed. |
| list-record-pop-success | This counts the number of blocks of free ports that have been successfully requested from the database. |
| list-record-push | This indicates the number of free ports returned to circulation. |

```

#### Description

The _show stats redundancy session-errors_ tables show statistics related to the 128T router&#39;s behavior when configured in a redundant (highly available) pair of nodes. The subcommands within _show stats redundancy session-errors_ provide more detail on each of the various counters and are discussed in the sections that follow.

These commands are typically only run at the request of 128 Technology&#39;s support team, and to diagnose specific network conditions. This information, when combined with 128T log output, will help the support team to isolate network anomalies.

| Subcommand | Description |
| --- | --- |
| cache-timeouts | After a failover event, inbound packets are queued as database queries are issued to reconstruct sessions. This counter is incremented when packets are dropped from the cache because a reply did not arrive from the database in time. |
| decode-failures | This counts the number of database responses that could not be decoded. This is generally due to a version compatibility problem. |
| fib-lookup-error | This counts the number of events where a session was found in the redundancy database, but the packet could not be processed because the corresponding FIB entry was not yet installed. |
| invalid-buffer-received | This error occurs when a reply from the database is not a valid buffer; this is a version compatibility problem. |
| new-session-creation-failure | For UDP packets, or mid-flow (i.e., non-SYN) TCP packets when transport-state-enforcement is disabled. |
| session-not-found | This statistic increments when a database query comes back with no match. |
| session-update-failures | This increments when an update to the redundancy database fails for an unspecified reason. |
| source-lookup-error | This counts the number of events where a session was found in the redundancy database, but the packet could not be processed because the corresponding source table entry was not yet installed. |
| unsupported-feature | This increments when a session reply returns an unsupported redundancy scenario. |

## show stats redundancy session-reads
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats redundancy session-reads [{ create-new-session | net-unreachable-sent | query-pending | query-result-not-found | query-result-success | query-result-timeout | tcp-reset-sent }] [node <node>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

The _show stats redundancy session-reads_ commands show statistics related to the 128T router&#39;s behavior when querying the redundancy database. After a redundancy event (where packet processing fails over from one node to another), the newly active node will query the redundancy database as inbound packets arrive to reconstruct stored session state that had been created by the formerly active node. This set of statistics shows the results of these "session read" queries.

| Subcommand | Description |
| --- | --- |
| create-new-session | This indicates that the query to the database succeeded, but resulted in no result; therefore, this is the first packet in a new session and will be created as such. |
| net-unreachable-sent | This is incremented when a query to the database fails; the active node will send back an ICMP network unreachable response. |
| query-pending | This shows the number of queries that have been sent to the database that have not (yet) received a reply. |
| query-result-not-found | This indicates the number of queries that were sent for which no matching entry was found in the database; this is generally because the packet received is the first of a new session. |
| query-result-success | This indicates the number of queries that responded back with a matching entry. |
| query-result-timeout | This counts the number of queries that timed out before receiving a reply from the database. |
| tcp-reset-sent | This counts the number of TCP RSTs that were sent by the 128T router because of failures in querying the redundancy database. |

| created-inter-router-service-paths | This counts the number of sessions that have been reconstructed where the ingress interface and egress interface are on different routers. |
| created-local-service-paths | This counts the number of sessions that have been reconstructed where the ingress and egress interfaces are on the same node. |
| diverted-to-external-protocol-agent | This is related to BGP recovery, and indicates the number of inbound packets that have been identified as BGP packets and subsequently "diverted" to be processed by the local RoutingManager (rather than be treated like a more typical session). |

## show stats routing
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats routing [{ errors | route-updates | routes }] [node <node-name>] [ <verbosity>]

#### Description

The _show stats routing_ command displays information about the internal interface between the 128T router&#39;s Route Table Manager (RTM) and its routing engine, from the perspective of its RTM. For each route the RTM receives, it increments add-route statistics. For each removal it receives, the delete-route statistics are incremented. The fib-meter shows a count of the number of FIB entries that the RTM has currently.

When the routing engine has sent a number of routing changes to RTM and wishes the RTM to "activate" these new changes, it informs the RTM to install the routes; this activity is captured in the output of the _show stats routing route-updates_ command.

The 128T router will increment _add-route_ when it receives new routes from the routing manager, and likewise will increment _delete-route_ when it receives instructions on removing routes from the routing manager. Once the routing manager is done with the route updates it will tell the routing agents to install the routes it has communicated; this event will increment the _install-route_ counter.

The fib-meter shows the current quantity of entries in the Forwarding Information Base.

The statistic tables are categorized into the types listed below:

| Modifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| adaptive-encryption-modify-packets | This counts all of the packets that are modified due to the engagement of adaptive-encryption on a flow/session. |
| bad-shared-mem-entry | This increments when packets have an invalid shared memory entry, and is evidence of possible memory corruption. |
| collision-modify-packets | This counts the number of packets that have experienced "collision" (when a packet is handled by the service logic on the 128T that already matches an existing session-in-progress) and that packet modifies the existing session&#39;s properties. |
| dropped-packets | This catches all conditions within the service area when it drops packets due to an error. |
| duplicate-reverse-metadata-packets | This counts all instances where the same reverse metadata is received more than one time. |
| empty-reverse-metadata-packets | This counts every instance of when metadata received on the reverse path contains no information. |
| existing-flows | This counts the number of packets received where a flow has already been installed by the service area. This most commonly occurs when several packets are sent by a client in rapid succession, and packets other than the first are sent to the service area while the service area is still in the process of installing the flow for the first one. This is a fairly common occurrence. |
| existing-session | This counts the total number of packets received by the service area that already have a session in progress. |
| existing-session-reverse-metadata-packets | This counts the number of reverse metadata packets that have arrived in the service area for a session that is already active. |
| external-protocol-agent-packets | This counts the number of packets received in the service area that were originated by an external protocol agent (128T internal). |
| fabric-packets | This counts the number of packets received on fabric interfaces and sent to the service area for processing. |
| flow-expired-reverse-metadata-packets | This is the number of packets containing reverse metadata that were received by the service area due to flow expiry. |
| flow-move-packets | This counts the number of packets that trigger a move from one destination to another. |
| invalid-reverse-metadata-packets | This increments whenever the service area deems that reverse metadata it has received is not parsable or has failed authentication. |
| mid-flow-modify-packets | This counts the number of packets that the fast path has sent to the service area to modify the properties of an existing flow; e.g., when routes change and a new interface needs to be used for an existing flow entry. |
| no-fib-entry | This counts the number of packets that were received but did not match a FIB entry. |
| non-fabric-packets | This counts the number of packets received on external interfaces and sent to the service area for processing. |
| reverse-metadata-process-failure | This increments whenever a 128T receives reverse metadata (e.g., the first packet received in response from a next-hop 128T that this router peers with), but that metadata could not be parsed properly. |
| session-collision-change-direction | A session collision is when two devices both send packets to each other through 128T devices and use "mirror image" sets of ports (the source of one flow is the same as the destination of the compliment); this is common for RTP, for example. One of these flows establishes a session, and the next will either change the direction (if it wins the tiebreaker) or be ignored (if it loses the tiebreaker). These two statistics count these interactions. |
| session-collision-ignore-drop ||
| session-collision-ignored ||
| session-ignored-reverse-metadata-packets | This counts the number of reverse metadata packets that have been ignored by a 128T for any number of possible conditions (e.g., no action required). |
| session-updated-reverse-metadata-packets | This counts the number of sessions that have been updated due to information contained within reverse metadata that the service area has received. |
| update-flow-with-peer-failure | This counts the number of reverse metadata packets that failed to update a flow. |
| update-flow-with-peer-success | This counts the number of reverse metadata packets that successfully updated a flow. |
| update-session-with-peer-failure | This counts the number of reverse metadata packets that failed to update a session. |
| update-session-with-peer-success | This counts the number of reverse metadata packets that successfully updated a session. |
| valid-reverse-metadata-packets | This counts the number of parsable, valid reverse metadata packets received by the service area. |

## show stats service-area sent
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats service-area sent { arp-resolve-failure | arp-resolve-pending | arp-resolve-success | success }
```

#### Description

The 128T router&#39;s service area is where flow installation logic and path selection logic reside. The first packet of every unknown flow is sent to the service area for disposition; the various subcommands within _show stats service-area_ count the number of events of various types to help illustrate its behavior.

| arp-resolve-failure | If the service area needs a MAC address for the destination it has selected for a new flow, it will send an ARP for it; if this ARP fails, the packets will be dropped and this counter will increment. |
| arp-resolve-pending | Packets waiting for an ARP to resolve will be queued in the service area, until the ARP succeeds or fails. This counter increments with each packet that queues, waiting for this ARP transaction. |
| arp-resolve-success | This counter increments once an ARP transaction has succeeded, for each queued packet that is sent. |
| success | This counter increments for each packet sent to the fast path successfully. |

#### Syntax

```
show stats service-area session-install-errors [{ duplicate-reverse-flow | fib-lookup | invalid-packet | service-paths-unavailable | urpf-check-failure | waypoint-allocation }]
```
#### Description

When the 128T router&#39;s service area receives the first packet of a new flow, for service traffic it will attempt to install a session â€“ a bidirectional set of flow entries into its flow table, for symmetrically forwarding traffic from client to server and vice versa. This table tallies the number of error cases when the service area fails to install a session.

| Modifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| duplicate-reverse-flow | The insert of new flow failed because of a reverse flow already matching the same criteria of an existing flow. (A reverse flow is the complement to a forward flow, and serves to send packets from the "server" to the "client" in a client/server transaction.) |
| fib-lookup | This counts the number of installation failures that occur due to a FIB lookup miss for the reverse flow. |
| gateway-lookup-failure | This increments when a session fails to be installed because a next-hop gateway lookup fails, and hence there is no way to egress the packet. |
| invalid-packet | This counts the number of times a packet that the service area cannot process causes a flow installation failure. |
| service-paths-unavailable | This counts the number of sessions that fail due to all possible service paths being unavailable (down, full, below thresholds, etc.). |
| urpf-check-failure | This counts the number of times the 128T router service area fails to install a reverse flow due to a uRPF (Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding) check. This is when a _router_ has its _reverse-flow-enforcement_ enumeration set to "strict", and the ingress interface is not the one that the 128T element would normally use for forwarding packets in the reverse direction. |
| waypoint-allocation | This counts the number of installation failures due to the service area&#39;s inability to allocate a waypoint for the new session (due to exhaustion of the available "waypoint pool"). |

## show stats session
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats session [active | add | added-existing | flow active | flow add failure | flow remove failure | max-remove-timeout-exceeded | remove] [since <since>] [node <node-name>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

Processing _sessions_ is at the heart of the 128T router&#39;s purpose: "vectoring" (or steering) forward and reverse flows through a network of one or more 128T routing nodes from a source to a destination. The _show stats session_ commands aggregate the statistics for session-oriented routing across various groupings to provide insight into the traffic patterns exercised by your 128T router.

The data from _show stats session_ is sampled by the 128T router periodically (at intervals of one second), so the output shown represents a view into the previous sample.

| Modifier | Description |
| --- | --- |
| active | This counts the number of active sessions that a given 128T (or node) is processing. |
| add | This counts the number of sessions that a 128T has added since its last reboot. |
| added-existing | This counts the number of times that the 128T router has attempted to add a flow that already exists. This is fairly common, and generally happens when a flow add request is in progress and more packets for that session arrive before the initial flow add request has been completed. Once the initial packet&#39;s flow creation event completes, the other packets will increment the statistics as _added-existing_. |
| flow active | This counts the number of active flows (generally, a session is comprised of two flows and this value should be roughly twice the number of active sessions). |
| flow add failure | This counts the number of times a flow failed to be added due to an internal error. |
| flow remove failure | This counts the number of times a flow failed to be removed due to an internal error. |
| max-remove-timeout-exceeded | This shows the number of instances where the 128T router&#39;s ability to remove expired flows is not keeping up. This is generally due to some type of resource exhaustion on the 128T router; this command is typically only used upon the request of 128 Technology&#39;s support team. |
| remove | This counts the number of sessions that a 128T has removed since its last reboot. |

## show stats source-nat
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats source-nat [{ active-tables | allocate-ports-for-db | giid-transition-to-active | giid-transition-to-inactive | inactive-tables | reinitialize-ports-in-db | release-ports-to-db | reserved-ports }] [node <node>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

The 128T router can optionally perform network address translation (NAT) on the source address of packets it forwards to remote destinations. When doing so, it will translate the original source IP:port "tuple" to a specific IP:port tuple on its egress interface â€“ and generally it maps many originating IPs to a single IP address, using the port as the differentiation.

To provide continuity of service after a failure of one member of a pair of highly available 128T routers, the ports allocated by an active node are written into a database and replicated to its complement in the pair. This way, in the event of a failure, the newly active node will be able to use the same ports that the failed peer had allocated.

The statistics in _show stats source-nat_ tally as various events occur within the port allocation, write to database, and failure events occur. This command is usually only run at the request of 128 Technology&#39;s support organization to diagnose a specific problem.

## show stats ssc
<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats ssc [{ clients | operations | received | sessions | transactions | transmitted }] [node <node>] [<verbosity>]
```

#### Description

The 128T router&#39;s System Services Coordinator (SSC) is a software process that acts as a registrar for the other software processes within the system. As other software processes launch, they will register as clients to the SSC, and these registration events are tallied in the statistical tables associated with the _show stats ssc_ command.

The _clients_ modifier shows the current number of active events that clients have triggered (connections, and disconnections) as well as the current number of registered clients. The _operations_ branch shows compression and decompression events that have occurred between the SSC client and server. The _received_ branch shows SSC messages that have been received, categorized into counters grouped by client, by service, and various error categories.

```

#### Description

The 128T router&#39;s traffic engineering subsystem is responsible for queuing inbound packets and scheduling them for transmission to their destination. The _show stats traffic-eng_ command tabulates the number of packets that have been scheduled (or failed to be scheduled) and sent (or failed to be sent).

The commands are grouped into two coarse categories: packets queued for a device port (i.e., on egress) or for internal application handling (i.e., on ingress).

```

#### Description

Much like the _source-nat_ feature, the 128T router performs network address translation (NAT) of packets it forwards to remote 128T routers. These packets are rewritten to have a source IP address of one of the transmitting router&#39;s "waypoints" â€“ an IP:port combination unique to that sending device. This is how the 128T router ensures that the return packets from that destination return using a symmetrical path, as the IP address is "owned" by a specific network element.

To provide continuity of service after a failure of one member of a pair of highly available 128T routers, the ports allocated by an active node are written into a database and replicated to its complement in the pair. This way, in the event of a failure, the newly active node will be able to use the same ports that the failed peer had allocated.

The statistics in _show stats waypoint_ tally as various events occur within the port allocation, write to database, and failure events occur. This command is usually only run at the request of 128 Technology&#39;s support organization to diagnose a specific problem.

<!-- Not updated to 4.3 -->
#### Syntax

```
show stats worker-core aes context [{ create [ { failure | success }] | destroy [{ failure | success }] ] [node <node>] [<verbosity>]

#### Description

The _show stats worker-core aes_ command shows statistics regarding the use of AES encryption/decryption on the 128T router, specifically regarding the treatment of AES inter-process communication control messages. The various subcommands are described here.

The _context_ sub-tree shows information on AES encryption contexts (an encryption context is a set of key-value pairs associated with an encryption/decryption session). The _context_ sub-tree can show _success_ or _failure_ statistics either the creation or destruction of these contexts; these are invoked with _show stats worker-core aes context create_ and _show stats worker-core aes context destroy_, respectively. Each of these commands will display a table similar to the following:
