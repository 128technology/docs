This process assumes you have already created a bootable device, either a USB or CD/DVD/Blueray disk. Instructions for downloading and creating a bootable device are available in [Downloading an SSR ISO](intro_downloading_iso.md) and [Creating a Bootable USB](intro_creating_bootable_usb.md).

The steps in this section describe the *interactive conductor installation* from the ISO. The section [Initialize the SSR](#initialize-the-128t-node) describes using the Initializer to configure the system as a Conductor after installing from the Interactive ISO. 

:::note
The Conductor installation must be completed before installing a router or routers using the OTP ISO.
:::

To install a router **after** installing and configuring the Conductor, use the [Router Installation](intro_installation_bootable_media.md#initialize-the-ssr-node); or the procedure [Router Installation Using OTP](intro_otp_iso_install.mdx) can be used to install complex router configurations. 

## Prerequisites

- Ensure that the platform you are installing on meets the SSR hardware requirements.
- Verify that the boot priority of the USB drive is properly listed in the system BIOS.
- Connect from your PC/Mac to the console port on the Device. 

## Installing the ISO

After imaging the ISO onto removable media, insert it into the target machine and power it on.

### Choose the Installation Type

Upon boot, the following screen is displayed. Not all hardware has video support, so booting to the serial console (115200 baud) is the default. 

To install using the Interactive Installation, use the arrow keys to select either `Install 128T Routing Software Serial Console` or **`Install 128T Routing Software VGA Console`**. As noted earlier, this guide describes the installation process using the Interactive Installation, specifically using the VGA console. The process for a Conductor or a Router is the same. 

![VGA Boot with Interactive Install](/img/install_select_interactive.png)

Differences for the serial console are described in [Serial Console Installation Information](#serial-console-installation-information). 

:::note
Not all hardware has video support. Booting to the serial console 115200 baud is the default, and is automatically selected after 30 seconds. When using the serial console, the terminal size is 80x25 - anything smaller may result in abnormal navigation behavior.

Selecting the wrong type of console (Serial or VGA) may result in garbled characters being displayed, and if left to continue will result in an incorrect installation. If the wrong console is selected, reboot the target system and select the correct line for the target hardware.
::: 

#### SSR System via Serial Console

Use this option when running on hardware with no video chipset. It uses `/dev/ttyS0` 115200 baud as the serial console for interacting with the installer. For serial console issues please refer to [Serial Console Troubleshooting](#serial-console-troubleshooting).

#### SSR System with VGA Console

Use this option when running on hardware that has onboard graphics chipsets. This installs SSR software using the GUI installer.

The procedure that follows here is the **Interactive Install on the VGA Console**.

### SSR Installation

After the Linux installation completes, the SSR software installation begins. Note that this may take several minutes to complete. After the installation has completed, the following screen is displayed:

![Installation Complete](/img/intro_installation_bootable_media_install_complete.png)

Shut down the system and remove the bootable media. Then power the system up to complete the installation process. 

- GUI login via HTTPS is enabled by default on port 443.

- The following user accounts and passwords are created during the ISO installation process:

   | Username | Password   | Access Scope |
   | -------- | ---------- | ------------ |
   | root     | 128tRoutes | Linux account |
   | t128     | 128tRoutes | Linux account |
   | admin | 128Tadmin | SSR PCLI admin account - see note below |
 
   It is *strongly recommended* that you change these passwords immediately.

  :::note
  The admin default password is only created during the OTP installation. There is no admin defaut for an interactive installation.
  :::

## Initial Boot and NMTUI

When the system boots from the `Install 128T Routing Software...` Interactive Installation work flow, the system asks whether to configure initial Linux Networking before the SSR Initializer is started.

![128T NetManager TUI Start](/img/Initializer_Serial0.png)

Selecting `Yes` launches the CentOS NMTUI application to perform an initial network interface setup.

![128T NetManager TUI Option](/img/Initializer_Serial1.png)

Refer to the NMTUI user documentation for more details.

## Initialize the SSR Node

The SSR Initializer tunes your operating system, prepares the platform to run the SSR software, and creates the bootstrapping files necessary to load the software. The Initializer is launched on first boot for the `Install 128T Routing Software...` installation options.

If you are installing a highly available Conductor on the cloud, please refer to [Conductor High Availability for Cloud Deployments](intro_initialize_HA_conductor.md).

1. On the SSR Initializer wizard screen, use the space bar to select the **Conductor**role for the SSR node, and press the **Enter** key to select **OK**.

  ![SSR Role](/img/initializer_Serial2.png)

2. If you have only one conductor (i.e., a standalone conductor), leave the field labeled 2nd Conductor Address blank. 

3. When asked _What kind of Router/Conductor node is this?_, select **Standalone** from the following options:

  ![Identify the Node](/img/initializer_Serial3.png)

- **Standalone:** This router/conductor has no highly available peer, and is not currently planned for high availability.

4. Enter the following system properties on the **Node Info** screen:

    ![Node Information](/img/initializer_Serial5.png)

    - **Node Name:** The name of the system within your SSR Router or Conductor, for example, _conductor_. By default this field uses the Linux system's hostname.

    :::note
    Both routers and conductors can consist of one node (for standalone systems) or two nodes (for highly available systems).
    :::
    - **Conductor Name:** The name of the Conductor system as a whole. When referring to a running SSR software instance, it is identifiable by the full name of `nodeName.routerName`; e.g., `conductor-node1.conductor`. The full system name is reflected in the PCLI prompt as discussed in the Document Conventions section of this document.

5. On the **Password Setup** screen, create a password for the SSR Admin user. The administrator password must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least 1 uppercase letter, at least 1 lowercase letter, at least 1 number, cannot contain the username in any form, and cannot repeat characters more than 3 times. This operation is only performed on the standalone or first node in the HA peer.
  :::note
  Resetting a password requires entering the old password. If a password is lost or forgotten and the account is inaccessible, the account cannot be recovered. Please keep password records accessible and secure. 
  :::

6. Press the **Enter** key to select **OK**. The Initializer performs a hardware compatibility check. The compatibility check may fail due to warnings or failure notices, which are displayed in the output script. If no failures are present, you can choose to continue with the installation even if multiple warnings exist. For information on why a specific test may have failed or generated a warning, contact Juniper Technical Support.

7. When prompted, either reboot your system or start SSR.

  :::note
  If installing the SSR software for the first time, a system reboot is required.

## Verify Installation

After installing the SSR Software it is important to verify that the installation was completed successfully.

### To Verify the SSR Installation:

1. Launch a command prompt window.

2. Execute the command:

   ```
   sudo systemctl status 128T
   ```

   **Result:** The service is listed as _Active (running)_.

   If the service is listed as _Inactive_, run the `sudo systemctl start 128T`Â command. This may take several minutes to fully launch the service.

3. Once the service is listed as _Active_, log into the system as Admin using the system default password.

   **Result:** The installation is verified.

4. Close the command prompt window. 

5. Use a web browser to navigate to the IP address of the SSR GUI.

6. Log in to the SSR GUI using the admin name and password you created earlier.
