### Initialize the SSR Node

The SSR Initializer tunes your operating system, prepares the platform to run the SSR software, and creates the bootstrapping files necessary to load the software. The Initializer is launched on first boot.

There are three different types of conductor installations; 
- Standalone Conductor 
- [Conductor High Availability](ha_conductor_install.mdx)
- [Conductor High Availability for Cloud Deployments](intro_initialize_HA_conductor.md)

### Standalone Conductor

1. On the SSR Initializer wizard screen, use the space bar to select the **Conductor** role for the SSR node, and press the **Enter** key to select **OK**.

2. When asked _What kind of Conductor node is this?_, select **Standalone** from the following options:

  ![Identify the Node](/img/initializer_standalone.png)

- **Standalone:** This conductor has no highly available peer, and is not currently planned for high availability.

3. Enter the following system properties on the **Node Info** screen:

    ![Node Information](/img/initializer_Serial5a.png)

    - **Node Name:** The name of the system within your Conductor, for example, _conductor-node1_. By default this field uses the Linux system's hostname. The node name identifies the conductor node under the **Conductor** element in the Authority. 

    :::note
    Both routers and conductors can consist of one node (for standalone systems) or two nodes (for highly available systems).
    :::
    - **Conductor Name:** The name of the Conductor system as a whole. When referring to a running SSR software instance, it is identifiable by the full name; e.g., `conductor-node1.conductor`. The full system name is reflected in the PCLI prompt.

4. On the **Password Setup** screen, create a password for the SSR Admin user. The administrator password must be at least 8 characters long, contain at least 1 uppercase letter, at least 1 lowercase letter, at least 1 number, cannot contain the username in any form, and cannot repeat characters more than 3 times. This operation is only performed on the standalone or first node in the HA peer, and the password must be entered twice. 
  :::note
  Resetting a password requires entering the old password. If a password is lost or forgotten and the account is inaccessible, the account cannot be recovered. Please keep password records accessible and secure. 
  :::

5. Press the **Enter** key to select **OK**. The Initializer performs a hardware compatibility check. The compatibility check may fail due to warnings or failure notices, which are displayed in the output script. If no failures are present, you can choose to continue with the installation even if multiple warnings exist. For information on why a specific test may have failed or generated a warning, contact Juniper Technical Support.

6. When prompted, select `<Yes>` to start the conductor.

## Configure the Token

To save repository access credentials, use the PCLI command `set software access-token`. For information on this command, see [`set software access-token`](cli_reference.md#set-software-access-token).

From the root user in the workflow above, run the `pcli` command to access the PCLI and configure the token.

```
[root@test-conductor ~]# pcli
Starting the PCLI...
root@node1.test-conductor# set software access-token <username> <password>

## Add the Conductor to the Authority

Take this opportunity to log into the Conductor GUI to complete the following operations. This will provide validation that the installation was successful, and familiarize you with GUI operations. 

1. Select the **Conductor** from the Authority menu on the left side of the GUI. 

 ![Configuration menu](/img/config_menu_gui.png)

2. Select the **Configure** icon.

 ![Conductor Configuration Icon](/img/conductor_config_icon.png)

3. Select the node for the conductor - in this example it is `node1`.

 ![Conductor Node](/img/conductor_node.png) 

4. Under **Associated Asset ID** select the hostname for the conductor.

 ![Asset ID](/img/conductor_asset-id.png)

5. Validate and Commit the changes to the configuration. 

### Set the Authority Name

The authority represents the complete set of all SSRs managed under a single organizational entity.

1. Return to the Authority level
2. Select the Authority Settings.

 ![Authority Settings](/img/conductor_authority_name.png)

3. Under Basic Information, enter the new Authority name.

 ![Basic Information](/img/conductor_authority_name2.png)

### Set the Conductor IP Address

1. Under Conductor Addresses, select ADD.
2. In the **New Conductor Address** window, enter the conductor public IP address.

3. Click Validate and Commit. Warnings will appear, advising you of the change.  

### Next Steps - Router Configuration

Congratulations, you have successfully installed and configured a conductor! The next step is to optimize the router onboarding process. Creating router configurations on the conductor allows individual routers to download the necessary configuration to get up and running smoothly. 

A sample branch router configuration is available as a [**template**](config_templates.md#default-templates) on the conductor. This is a great place to start the configuration process. Additionally, you can create configuration templates that allow administrators to automate the configuration of top level resources. For more information, see [Configuration Templates](config_templates.md).
