---

SSR software version 6.3.0 and newer allows a Conductor to manage routers running image-based software, manage routers running older, package-based software, and initiate image-based upgrades to those routers.

Image-based installations provide many benefits over the earlier RPM package-based installation/upgrade process, including upgrade speed, stability, efficiency, and ease of use. This section describes the process for upgrading a Conductor, allowing it to manage both package-based and image-based routers.

:::note
Before upgrading a conductor, it is recommended to [export the running configuration](config_basics.md#importexport).

For systems with both primary and secondary conductors, it is a best practice to upgrade only one conductor at a time. 
:::

## Upgrade using the GUI

Use the following procedures to upgrade a Conductor from the GUI.

1. Select **Conductor** under Authority.
2. In the **Node: Conductor** panel, select the **Manage SSR Software** icon (the arrow within a circle). This icon displays green when upgrades are available. 
3. In the **Upgrade SSR** window, use the drop down to select the SSR version for the upgrade. 
4. Click **Proceed**.

The Upgrade screen displays the Raw Log with the upgrade progress. Once the upgrade is complete, the Conductor is restarted and the GUI is refreshed. 

## Upgrading Using the CLI

Use the `request system software upgrade` command and the associated arguments to perform upgrades. All of the upgrade features are available from the command line as well as the GUI. 

```
admin@conductor-node-1.Conductor# request system software upgrade
usage: upgrade [{router <router> | resource-group <resource-group>}] [simultaneous] [skip-package-transfer] [skip-pre-check]
               [skip-health-check] [cohort-id <cohort-id>] [force] [node <node>] version <version>
keyword arguments:
cohort-id                 Assign a cohort ID to the operation.
force                     Skip confirmation prompt.
node                      The name of the node
resource-group            The name of the resource group
router                    The router on which to upgrade SSR software (default: Conductor)
simultaneous              Upgrade both nodes in an HA router at the same time to maximize speed but interrupt service. Only valid when targeting a router.
skip-health-check         Skip the post upgrade health check, which reverts to the previous version upon failure.
skip-package-transfer     Don't transfer any packages installed on top of the current SSR ISO to the new SSR ISO. Only valid for
                          image based systems.
skip-pre-check            Skip the pre upgrade health check, which prevents the upgrade from starting upon failure.
version                   The targeted upgrade version.

request system software downgrade       Downgrade to a new version of the SSR.
request system software download        Download a new version of the SSR.
request system software health-check    Perform a health check of an SSR.
request system software revert          Revert to a previous version of the SSR.

#### Image-based and Package-based Installation Status

The image-based and package-based status is visible under **Install Type** in the PCLI using `show assets`.

:::note
The states displayed in the `status` column under `show assests` have changed. The old and new states are mapped below. 

| Old | New |
| --- | ---|
| Disconnected | Disconnected |
| Connected | Synchronizing or Resynchronizing |
| Running | Synchronized |

## High Availability Upgrades

In a high availability configuration, the default behavior is to perform a sequenced self-upgrade from the CLI. Executing the `request system software upgrade router <conductor-router-name>` from an HA conductor launches a sequenced self upgrade, one node at a time. In a situation where you prefer to upgrade each node manually, you can target each node directly using `request system software upgrade router <conductor-router-name> node <conductor-node-name>`. When the upgrade is complete on the first node, you may run the command on the second node.  

#### Other HA Considerations

* If an HA pair is discovered to have a mismatched software state (image-based and package-based) an Alarm is reported. The software state must be the same for both nodes.
* Failure of a router to complete the conversion generates a user visible event and records the reasons for the failure on the conductor.
* Router conversion success generates an event recording the transition on the router.
* The image-based and package-based status is visible in the PCLI using `show assets`.

#### Plugin Support

The conversion/upgrade process preserves the currently installed plugin packages. In cases where the plugin has version dependencies, the plugin is upgraded.
