Once the SSR portion of the onboarding process is complete, each router is displayed on the Mist inventory page under **Organization > Inventory**. Select Gateways on the top of the page to see a list of the routers and status. The router is listed as Unassigned, and must be assigned to the appropriate site.

:::note
Sites must have already been created - there is no option to create a site in the drop down.
:::

1. Select the Unassigned router.
2. Click on the **More** drop down on the upper right corner.
3. Select **Assign to Site**.
4. In the Assign Gateway dialog, select the appropriate site from the drop down.
5. Click on **Assign to Site**.

Once the site assignment is complete, the information is relayed back to the corresponding SSR router, and the router begins streaming the telemetry data to the cloud.
