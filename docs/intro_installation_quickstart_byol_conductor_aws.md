sidebar_label: Installing a BYOL Conductor-managed Router in AWS
---
This guide describes the process for deploying a BYOL Session Smart Conductor and a BYOL Session Smart Router (SSR) in AWS.

The installation and deployment process consists of the following steps:

* [Selecting the AMI](#selecting-the-ami).
* Deploying a [Session Smart Conductor](#session-smart-conductor-deployment).
* Deploying the [Session Smart Conductor Managed Router](#session-smart-conductor-managed-router-deployment).

Proceed to the next section [Selecting the AMI](#selecting-the-ami).

:::note
BYOL instances only support image-based installations, and require the conductor to run 6.3.0-R1 or newer in order to manage these instances.
:::

### Selecting the AMI

The **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** AMI allows you to install your own licensed copy of the SSR software on an AWS VM. Artifactory credentials are required to authenticate access to the installation repositories. Refer to the [Session Smart Networking Platform (BYOL)](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/pp/prodview-lz6cjd43qgw3c?sr=0-2&ref_=beagle&applicationId=AWSMPContessa) offering.

Once you have selected the AMI for your deployment, proceed to the section [Session Smart Conductor Deployment](#session-smart-conductor-deployment) to deploy a Session Smart Conductor, or proceed to the section [Session Smart Conductor Managed Router Deployment](#session-smart-conductor-managed-router-deployment) to deploy a Session Smart Conductor Managed Router.

## Session Smart Conductor Deployment

Use the following information to deploy a BYOL Session Smart Conductor in AWS.

### Requirements

The following infrastructure must exist in your AWS account:
* A VPC where the Conductor will be deployed.
* The existing VPC is segmented with at least one subnet.
  * The subnet is reachable for SSH and HTTPs access for administration purposes.
  * The Session Smart Routers managed by this Conductor must be able to reach the IP address of the Conductor in this subnet.

### Deployment

A Conductor can be deployed manually via the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) or in an automated fashion using AWS CLI commands. This section describes both methods. Choose the method that better suits your needs.

When deploying the Session Smart Conductor using the templates referenced in this section, the following infrastructure elements are created automatically to assist with the deployment process:
* EC2 instance with the Session Smart image specified in the template.
* The Conductor is deployed with a single network interface identified as the control interface.
 * There is a network security group associated with the control interface.
 * The control interface has a unique and static public IP address.

The following image shows the infrastructure elements deployed:

### Using the AWS Console

To deploy the Session Smart Networking software via the AWS Console:

1. Click the **Session Smart Networking Platform BYOL** offering.
2. Click **Continue to Subscribe** and accept the terms and conditions.
3. Click **Continue to Configuration**.
4. In the **Fulfillment Option** drop down select the **CloudFormation Template**, then select the **Juniper Session Smart Counductor** template, and select the desired region.

4. In the **Fulfillment Option** drop down box select **CloudFormation Template**, then select the **Juniper Session Smart Conductor** template and select the desired region.
5. Click **Continue to Launch**.
6. In the **Choose Action** box, select **Launch CloudFormation** and select **Launch**.
7. Copy the URL of the template in the **Amazon S3 URL** field.

Launch the deployment with the corresponding AWS CLI commands making use of the S3 URL of the template identified previously. For a description of the parameters of the template, please refer to [Launch the Conductor Template](#launch-the-conductor-template).

### Cloud-init Onboarding
When launching an AWS EC2 instance using automation the following user-data section can be leveraged to setup the onboarding data for the instance. Additionally, this method can be used to further customize the conductor onboarding configuration.

```
#cloud-config
write_files:
  - path: /etc/128T-hardware-bootstrapper/onboarding-config.json
    content: |
        {
            "name": "<conductor-name>",
            "ssr-version": "<version>",
            "mode": "conductor",
            "artifactory-user": "<username>",
            "artifactory-password": "<password>",
            "node-name": "node0"
        }
```

| Option | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| name | The name of the router. By default, the instance name is used. |
| ssr-version | The SSR software version to be installed on the instance. (BYOL only) |
| artifactory-user | User portion of the artifactory credentials. |
| artifactory-password | Password portion of the artifactory credentials. |
| node-name | The name of the node being provisioned. For a standalone conductor, this is `node0`. |

Additional Conductor configuration options can be found in [Initialize Your Device - Advanced Workflows.](initialize_u-iso_adv_workflow.md#initialize-a-conductor)

### Manual Onboarding
If a user does not supply the onboarding configuration before launching the instance, the onboarding steps can be manually executed.

1. Log into the instance using the default AWS username `ec2-user` and the key pair provided when launching.
2. Run `/usr/libexec/hardwareBootstrapper128t config-generator`
3. Follow the prompts to generate and apply the onboarding configuration.

## Session Smart Conductor Managed Router Deployment

Use the following guide to deploy a BYOL Session Smart Conductor Managed Router in AWS.

### Requirements

The following infrastructure must exist in your AWS account:
* A VPC where the Session Smart Router will be deployed.
* The existing VPC is segmented with at least the following three subnets:
  - **Public Subnet**: This subnet must provide connectivity to enable communication with external/remote SSR peers.
  - **Private Subnet**: This subnet must provide connectivity to internal workloads within the cloud.
  - **Management Subnet**: This subnet is used for conductor-managed deployments, and has the following requirements:
    * The subnet is reachable for SSH for administration purposes.
    * The interface of the Conductor that manages this router must be reachable from this subnet.
* [Enable enhanced network](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/enhanced-networking-ena.html#enabling_enhanced_networking) with ENA for maximum throughput performance. For SSR routers, execute the following command from your local computer:

```
aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id instance_id --ena-support
```

### Deployment

A Session Smart Router can be deployed manually via the [AWS Console](https://console.aws.amazon.com) or in an automated fashion using AWS CLI commands. This section describes both methods. Choose the method that better suits your needs.

When deploying the Session Smart Router using the templates referenced in this section, the following infrastructure elements are created automatically to assist with the deployment process:
* EC2 instance with the Session Smart image specified in the template.
* The router is deployed with appropriate network interfaces as described [here](#requirements-1)
* Each network interface has a network security group associated. The network security groups are configured in accordance with the requirements to deploy a fabric with Session Smart Networking software.
* The public and management interfaces have a unique and static public IP address associated.

The following image shows the infrastructure elements deployed:

| Tag Value | Meaning |
| --------- | ------- |
| WAN       | Interface is marked as WAN for onboarding purposes. |
| LAN       | Interface is marked as LAN and is assumed to be used as a private network for internal workflows. |

:::note
The EC2 instance must be assigned the IAM role containing the `ec2_describeNetwork` permission to leverage the interface tagging.
:::

## Troubleshooting

### Device Does Not Initalize Properly

Once the instance is launched with the correct parameters, the device will begin to install the SSR software. After installing the software, the device will either initialize as a Conductor or automatically onboard to the associated conductor. This process can take up to 15 minutes to complete.

If the instance does not install SSR as expected, SSH into the instance using the credentials provided during VM creation.

- Try to log into the pcli, run `su admin` and then `show system`.

- If the pcli is not accessable or the status and necessary action is not obvious, capture the Hardware Bootstrapper tech support (`/var/log/128T-hardware-bootstrapper/hardware-bootstrapper-tech-support.zip`) and examine the journal for `128T-hardware-bootstrapper`, and `ember`.
