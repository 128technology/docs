<!---Interactive Install Overview--->

This process assumes you have already created a bootable device using a USB. Instructions for downloading and creating a bootable device are available in [Downloading an SSR ISO](intro_downloading_iso.md) and [Creating a Bootable USB](intro_creating_bootable_usb.md).

The steps in this section describe the *interactive conductor installation* from the packaged-based ISO. The section [Initialize the Conductor](#initialize-the-conductor-node) describes using the Initializer to configure the system as a Conductor after installing from the Interactive ISO.

:::note
The Conductor installation must be completed before installing a Session Smart Router or routers using the ISO. The same ISO is used for both installations.
:::

To install a router **after** installing and configuring the Conductor, use the [SSR Installation](intro_installation_bootable_media.mdx). The [Router Installation Using OTP](intro_otp_iso_install.mdx) procedure can be used for whitebox and air-gap, conductor-managed network installations.
