Transport-based Encryption allows you to select specific links for encryption, for example public broadband and LTE, and disable encryption on trusted links. This reduces the perfomance hit taken when encrypting traffic over an already secure transport link. When a failover occurs from a trusted link to a public connection, payload encryption can be enabled to maintain the secure connection.
