### Show Commands

**(need more information, better troubleshooting information)**

The `show idp application` and its sub-commands provide information about the running state of the IDP engine. 

```
admin@node.idp # show idp application status

```

### Stats and Metrics 

The `show stats idp` metrics track the number of packets and bytes sent in/out of the IDP engine. Additionally, data is captured by protocol such as UDP, TCP, ICMP etc. 

Alarms 

When IDP is configured on a router, an alarm is generated if the IDP engine is in a failed state. The alarm clears when the IDP engine is operational. 

Logs 

The `show tech-support` info contains the relevant logs and journals associated with the IDP engine.
