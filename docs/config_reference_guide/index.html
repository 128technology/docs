Each of the elements listed below contains the location of that element within the &quot;configuration tree&quot; -- i.e., the path through the configuration hierarchy.</p><p>Each field, its data type, valid range (as applicable, if it deviates from its standard type), and a description of that field follows. References to other objects are noted as such. Fields that are mandatory are flagged. The term &quot;key field&quot; -- usually the &quot;name&quot; of a given element -- is what the 128T router uses as its &quot;index&quot; for that element, meaning it must be globally unique within a given system&#x27;s configuration (and is how other elements will refer to it, as applicable).</p><h1><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="anchor enhancedAnchor_ZqCz" id="access-policy-service"></a><a aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1" class="hash-link" href="#access-policy-service" title="Direct link to heading">#</a>access-policy (service)</h1><p>Path:</p><p>authority &gt; service &gt; access-policy</p><p>Description:</p><p>Access policies are a multiple instance sub-element within a service configuration.

This field is only configurable when <em>peer</em> specifies another 128T element.</td></tr><tr><td>qp-value</td><td>uint32</td><td>An integer representing the quality points on the link between this node and its adjacent network element. Quality points are assigned to links from low values (representing bulk traffic links) to high values (representing managed, high-quality links).

Each source-nat-address is set to the address and prefix of the far-end NAT between this adjacency, and the network-interface on this node used to reach that adjacency. For NATs that use a single address, the prefix should be set to /32. For NATs that use a pool, the prefix should be set accordingly. Note: extreme caution should be used when configuring 0.0.0.0/0 in an attempt to &quot;wildcard&quot; the source-nat-address; network-interface configuration elements that do not have tenants associated with them (or those that do, where the tenant has no configured prefixes) will potentially collide with this configuration and lead to undesirable behavior.</td></tr><tr><td>vector</td><td>string</td><td>Multiple instance.

The 128T router&#x27;s term &quot;service class&quot; is used as defined in RFC 4594, &quot;Configuration Guidelines for DiffServ Service Classes&quot;, which states:</p><p>A &quot;service class&quot; represents a set of traffic that requires specific delay, loss, and jitter characteristics from the network. Conceptually, a service class pertains to applications with similar characteristics and performance requirements, such as a &quot;High-Throughput Data&quot; service class for applications like the web and electronic mail, or a \&quot;Telephony\&quot; service class for real-time traffic such as voice and other telephony services. Such a service class may be defined locally in a Differentiated Services (DS) domain, or across multiple DS domains, possibly extending end to end.</p><p>The 128T router uses service classes to prioritize session flows through its traffic management subsystem. Service classes are assigned to traffic classes, which are in turn assigned to services, and each service class is mapped to one of four built-in traffic classes (high, medium, low, or best-effort). The 128T&#x27;s traffic management subsystem uses these traffic-classes when scheduling packets for delivery to reserve bandwidth for each class, per egress interface.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Element</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>description</td><td>string</td><td>A field for containing human-readable information.

When set to false, the values configured in max-jitter, max-latency, and max-loss are ignored.</td></tr><tr><td>qp-preference</td><td>enumeration</td><td>Valid values: highest, lowest. After filtering out next hops that do not meet this service-class&#x27;s required-qp value, the 128T router will order them from highest to lowest (when this is set to highest), or lowest to highest (when this is set to lowest). This determines whether a service&#x27;s traffic will take the best quality link available, or the minimum viable link available.</td></tr><tr><td>required-qp</td><td>uint32</td><td>The required number of Quality Points for this service.

Default: none. This governs how the 128T router provides resilience for sessions in the event of network issues that would cause it to choose a new path for active traffic processing. The default &quot;none&quot; will take no action in the event of failure. The value &quot;failover&quot; will cause the 128T to seek another path for traffic when a failure is detected. The value &quot;revertible-failover&quot; will seek another path, but return to the previous path when the disruption is deemed to be restored. The value &quot;packet-duplication&quot; causes the 128T router to generate two sets of packets and sends them on multiple, distinct paths to the destination -- where the recipient 128T router filters the duplicates out prior to forwarding the traffic.</td></tr><tr><td>transport-state-enforcement</td><td>enumeration</td><td>Valid values: allow, block, reset. Default: reset. This governs the behavior of a router&#x27;s TCP state machine when receiving unexpected packets. When set to &#x27;reset&#x27;, if a router receives a TCP packet that does not match any session-in progress and the SYN flag is not set, or it receives a packet that does match a session in progress but it does not conform to the router&#x27;s TCP state machine (e.g., the sequence number is outside the expected window), the router will send a RST back to the sender. Setting this field to &#x27;allow&#x27; causes the router to pass non-SYN first packets and non-conforming packets (per the TCP state machine&#x27;s expectations). The &#x27;block&#x27; setting causes the router to silently discard non-SYN first packets and non-conformant packets (again, per the state machine).</td></tr><tr><td>vector</td><td>sub-element</td><td>The vector sub-element is where administrators assign costs to vector labels (which are associated with neighborhoods on egress interfaces), to assist in choosing the most appropriate path for traffic that references this service-policy.

Tenants are defined within an <em>authority</em>, and can span one or more <em>routers</em> within that authority. I.e., the services made available to that tenant can exist anywhere within the authority, irrespective of router, and the 128T router propagates routing information throughout the tenant to advertise the service&#x27;s availability irrespective of the client&#x27;s location. Essentially, tenants are intended to provide complete network segregation. Traffic from one tenant will not be allowed to traverse through another tenant&#x27;s network, unless explicitly configured to do so.</p><p>An example for how tenants could be used would be segregating engineering from accounting within an organization. Another example would be multiple customers within the AWS infrastructure. Each tenant would be a different customer.</p><p>In the absence of any configured tenants (that is, no logical partitioning in the configuration), all services are said to belong to the implicit tenant within the authority, referred to as <em>tenant zero</em>. Tenant zero always exists; provisioning any tenant does not remove <em>tenant zero.</em></p><p>The 128T router includes the ability to construct hierarchical tenancies, where a &quot;parent&quot; tenant may have zero or more &quot;child&quot; tenants. The hierarchical tenant model allows administrators to create arbitrary groups of tenants and apply policies to that group as a whole, rather than piecemeal. Furthermore, tenants are not restricted to a single hierarchy; two separate parent tenants can both reference the same child tenant, and policies applied to those parent tenants can have different attributes (referred to as &quot;service policies&quot;). Creating these groups of tenants affords the maximum flexibility and minimizes the amount of redundant configuration.</p><p>The 128T router uses a dotted notation naming scheme for grouping hierarchies of tenants. For example, a tenant named engineering.128technology is a child of the tenant 128technology. When other configuration objects refer to tenants, the effective scope can be controlled by specifying only a portion of a tenant&#x27;s name. For example, a service that specifies 128technology as the tenant is available to engineering.128technology, finance.128technology, and 128technology.</p><p>It is not necessary for an administrator to explicitly create a &quot;parent&quot; tenant prior to creating a &quot;child&quot; tenant (the UI will perform validation and warn an administrator that their action of creating a child tenant will also create a parent tenant). The UI will prevent the deletion of a parent tenant if it has any child tenants.</p><table><thead><tr><th>Element</th><th>Type</th><th>Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>description</td><td>string</td><td>A field for containing human-readable information.

When validation fails, the configuration interface will return error messages to alert you to the fact that your input has not been accepted. This section lists the error messages that the system can return, why the error was generated, and suggested corrective action (if any).</p><p>| Error | Message | Description |
| attribute | [attribute] | not allowed here                                This error occurs when trying to configure an attribute that does not exist. The CLI and GUI are not capable generating this error; it can only be generated by a third party NETCONF client. |
| document | incompletely | matched                                           This error is typically generated when a request contains invalid XML (e.g., missing an end tag). The CLI and GUI are not capable of generating this error; it can only be generated by a third party client. |
| Duplicate | key | [name]                                                  This error is generated when a third party client attempts to create an element with a key field that matches a pre-existing object with the same value in its key field. (The CLI and GUI cannot create duplicated key fields.) |
| Duplicate | leaf-list | entry [name]                                      This error is generated when a third party client attempts to create a sub-element with a key field that matches a pre-existing object with the same value in its key field. (The CLI and GUI cannot create duplicated key fields.) |
| Each | [name] | must have a unique value                                  This error is generated when two attributes are configured to the same value, but they are required to be unique. E.g., two VLANs on the same network-interface are both set to the same value. |
| element | [name] | invalid                                                This error can occur for a variety of reasons; the response text will supply more details about what has failed; e.g., <em>does not meet constraints</em>, <em>invalid length</em>, <em>must be greater than [value]</em>. |
| element | [name] | missing required attribute [attribute]               This error occurs when trying to create an element that has one or more mandatory attributes that have not been supplied. The CLI and GUI are not capable generating this error; it can only be generated by a third party NETCONF client. |
| element | [name] | missing required element [name]                      This error occurs when trying to create an element that has one or more mandatory sub-elements that have not yet been created. |
| element | [name] | not allowed here                                       This error occurs when trying to create an element at the wrong location of the configuration hierarchy. The CLI and GUI are not capable generating this error; it can only be generated by a third party NETCONF client. |
| element | [name] | not allowed yet; missing required element [name]     This error occurs when trying to configure or modify an element that exists but the request is missing a key attribute (and the 128T system cannot discern which element to configure/modify). The CLI and GUI are not capable generating this error; it can only be generated by a third party NETCONF client. |
| Field | [name] | may only be configured when [attribute] is [value]   This error is generated when an attribute is only configurable under a certain condition, and that attribute is configured but the condition is not met. E.g., the &#x27;pci-address&#x27; attribute within the device-interface is only configurable when the <em>type</em> of that interface is set to &#x27;ethernet&#x27;. If the pci-address attribute is set (or has been set) when the interface&#x27;s <em>type</em> is set to &#x27;kni&#x27;, this validation error will occur. |
| found | attribute | [attribute], but no attributes allowed here           This error occurs when trying to configure an attribute within an element that has no attributes. The CLI and GUI are not capable generating this error; it can only be generated by a third party NETCONF client. |
| Found | fields | that are only valid when [attribute] is [value]        This error is generated when attributes are set when a specific condition is met, but that condition has been violated. E.g., when the type of the routing-protocol is set to &#x27;bgp&#x27;, various attributes are available to be configured; if these attributes are set, and the routing-protocol is later set to a value other than &#x27;bgp&#x27;, these dependent attributes are in violation. |
| Reference | to | element [name] which does not exist                      This is generated when an object refers to another object within the configuration, but the referenced object has not yet been created. This condition must be rectified before the configuration can be committed. |
| text | not | allowed here                                                   This error occurs when inserting text within an XML element that cannot contain text. The CLI and GUI are not capable generating this error; it can only be generated by a third party NETCONF client. |
| unknown | element | [name]                                                This error occurs when trying to configure an element that does not exist in the 128T data model. The CLI and GUI are not capable of configuring unknown elements; this error can only be generated by a third party NETCONF client. |
| value | of | attribute [attribute] is invalid                             This error occurs when trying to configure an attribute with a value that does not meet the validation criteria for the attribute. Refer to the pertinent section of this guide above for the valid criteria for the specific attribute. The CLI and GUI are not capable generating this error; it can only be generated by a third party NETCONF client. |</p><div class="footnotes"><hr><ol><li id="fn-1">For more information on the management address assignation process, refer to the 128T Installation Guide.<a href="#fnref-1" class="footnote-backref">↩</a></li></ol></div></div></article><div class="margin-vert--xl"><div class="row"><div class="col"><a href="https://github.com/128technology/docs/tree/master/docs/config_reference_guide.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><svg fill="currentColor" height="1.2em" width="1.2em" preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet" viewBox="0 0 40 40" style="margin-right:0.3em;vertical-align:sub"><g><path d="m34.5 11.7l-3 3.1-6.3-6.3 3.1-3q0.5-0.5 1.2-0.5t1.1 0.5l3.9 3.9q0.5 0.4 0.5 1.1t-0.5 1.2z m-29.5 17.1l18.4-18.5 6.3 6.3-18.4 18.4h-6.3v-6.2z"></path></g></svg>Edit this page</a></div><div class="col text--right"><em><small>Last updated on <time datetime="2020-04-13T16:02:49.000Z" class="docLastUpdatedAt_1sqk">4/13/2020</time></small></em></div></div></div><div class="margin-vert--lg"><nav class="pagination-nav"><div class="pagination-nav__item"></div><div class="pagination-nav__item pagination-nav__item--next"></div></nav></div></div></div><div class="col col--3"><div class="tableOfContents_TbNY"><ul class="contents contents__left-border"><li><a href="#audience" class="contents__link">Audience</a></li><li><a href="#purpose" class="contents__link">Purpose</a></li><li><a href="#documentation-feedback" class="contents__link">Documentation Feedback</a></li></ul></div></div></div></div></div></main></div></div><footer class="footer"><div class="container"><div class="text--center"><div>Copyright © 2020 128 Technology, Inc.</div></div></div></footer>
